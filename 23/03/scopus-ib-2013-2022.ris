AB  - Emergency responders require accurate geographic information to locate and assess incidents reported on social media. Unfortunately, however, social media often lacks geographic metadata or includes geotags that inaccurately reflect the locations of reported events. Toponyms, place names in social media content, provide another source of geographic information yet toponym usage in emergencies remains poorly understood. To address this gap, this study examines toponym usage across 22,343 tweets posted during a severe storm in the Northeastern United States. Tweets were qualitatively coded for nineteen types of storm-related information as well as toponym usage, location reference, and granularity. Findings show that users i) include more geographic information, including toponyms and geotags, in tweets about emergencies than about other topics; ii) report geographically distributed events but tend to include toponyms rather than geotags when reporting local information; and iii) include mostly municipal and regional toponyms in tweets about emergencies but tend to include hyperlocal toponyms and additional municipal or regional markers in reports of infrastructure damage and service disruption. Together these findings offer implications for social sensing applications in emergency response and management. These include more opportunities for course-grained damage assessment than fine-grained situational awareness, and the need for internal and external sources of geographic information to distinguish information about local and remote events. Lastly, findings suggest opportunities for passive and active sensing approaches responsive to the recipient design of social media: users provide additional geographic context that help others distinguish local and remote risks within noisy information spaces that emerge during geographically distributed crises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Social network has become an important channel for people to obtain information.Trusted user information behavior is the key to build cyberspace security. A dynamic reputation evaluation method based on supervision feedback of user information behavior is helpful to promote social network self-discipline and achieve good community autonomy. The comprehensive reputation evaluation of each node integrates identity and behavior reputation. And the reputation is dynamically updated by setting the new node evaluation period and phased update mechanism. Identity reputation is calculated by information disclosure and network characteristics; Behavior reputation is calculated by information release and forwarding, and rewards or punishments will be given to self-correction of information behavior or blocking of bad information. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional trust evaluation mechanism, setting rewards and punishments guidance can improve the accuracy of reputation evaluation. At the same time, reputation incentive can also inhibit the interaction of bad information while promoting the consciousness of reporting.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

AB  - This paper contributes to the conceptualization of information creation in the field of information behavior. To do so, it synthesizes discussions and conceptual models on information creation and related topics, such as communication, design and documentation, which to date have been disconnected. A number of models are discussed, as well as some of the strengths, weaknesses and unique contributions of each with respect to information creation. This discussion leads to a number of paths for further research, both conceptual and empirical, on information creation. In particular, one fruitful site for further research in information creation is art. Drawing on the ground-breaking work of Tidline, it is clear that art is informative, and that the activities involved in and surrounding the creation of art showcase the aspects of information creation that have been highlighted in theoretical models of information behavior. Further research should consider the information behavior involved in an artistic task from start to finish. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse how elite politicians in opposition in the Norwegian parliament use information when responding to government propositions and investigate if Chatman’s small world conception can explain the socially and economically highly privileged groups’ approach to information. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative analysis of the data consisting of eight interviews with seven members of parliament (MPs) and one political advisor is based on a selective coding grounded to Chatman’s six propositions on life in the round. Findings: The overall findings indicate that elite politicians’ information practices concentrate in mastering the flow of information and admitting attention selectively, but on broad topics. Whereas MPs information practices within an intentional approach (i.e. to be used in political responses and debates) aligned with the small world idea, the nebulous approach (i.e. keeping updated on societal issues) breaks the boundaries of their “small worlds”. Originality/value: The study provides a glimpse into information practises of a little studied group, elite politicians. Moreover, it applies Chatman’s conception of small world in a novel manner. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The tattoo information experience reveals possibilities to explore how tattoo images are created as things, what actions lead to the creation of a tattoo image, who is considered a creator of a tattoo image, and how different personal, social and cultural contexts influence creation of information through the tattoo acquisition experience. Based on the findings from nine interviews, the process of tattoo information creation was conceptualized encompassing all stages of the tattoo experience: from the moment the first idea of getting a tattoo emerges to sharing of information about a tattoo. Participants' stories about their tattoo experiences were used to develop a framework of four key phases of tattoo information creation: conceptualizing, verbalizing, visualizing, and pluralizing. These phases occur between four anchors identified in the participants' stories: anticipation, identification, ideation, and creation. This framework can be used to assist future empirical and theoretical research on tattoo information experience. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Conventional pesticides are associated with numerous human and environmental health risks. Nevertheless, an increasing number of smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries are using conventional pesticides. Adopting safer pest management requires farmers to obtain new information. However, little is known how farmers develop an information need, seek, and use pest management related information, and whether this process differs for organic and conventional pest management strategies. In this qualitative study, we investigated pest-related information behavior in depth, from farmers’ own perspective. Using an ethnographic approach, we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews, 15 on-farm observations and 302 structured questionnaire interviews with farmers in Wakiso District, Uganda, in 2017. Our results indicated that farmers develop information needs when adopting new farming practices, or when presented with disruptive information (e.g. when new pests emerged). This prompted farmers to seek information actively, or they received passive information. Whether farmers used the new information depended on successful trial of the new pest management strategy, and on the credibility of the source. Most revealing, our results suggested important differences in information behavior between conventional and organic pest management strategies. Sources of information for conventional pesticides were well-integrated into farmers’ daily lives and comprised pesticide dealers and fellow farmers. Conversely, information on organic strategies was provided through external sources (e.g. NGOs), and was not available at times when farmers developed an information need. Our results imply that farmers are most likely receptive to organic pest management information at times when they develop an information need (e.g. when encountering a new pest). To promote safer pest management, information about organic and integrated pest management should be made continuously available in farmers’ lives. Furthermore, we recommend leveraging established information channels (e.g. dealers) among pesticide users to promote safer use practices. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how individuals' personal information organization reflects their social environments in order to understand social aspects of personal information organization. Design/methodology/approach: By using a cognitive sociological approach and based on the personal information organization process (PIOP) model (Oh, 2019), this study investigates the social aspects of personal information organization by analyzing the pre-diary interview, a diary, and two post-diary interviews conducted with each of the 18 information users in social science academic environments. Findings: Social dimensions of personal information organization were found in differences between organizing academic and non-academic files, the way participants identified and made distinctions among files, common folders they created, and with the impact of participants' professional age on personal information organization. This study shows that information organization is a process of construction and that the participants' social foundations are reflected in the way they view and organize their files. Originality/value: This study makes a unique contribution to the field by explaining the social aspects of personal information organization. The findings of this study deepen our knowledge of personal information organization by providing different ways to understand how and why people organize their files in certain ways, and by showing that this is not just individual behavior. In practice, this study provides insight into the design of applications and tools that support personal information management of people in specific social environments. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Information behavior, as a part of human behavior, has many aspects, including a cognitive aspect. Cognitive biases, one of the important issues in psychology and cognitive science, can play a critical role in people's behaviors and their information behavior. This article discusses the potential relationships between some concepts of human information behavior and cognitive biases. The qualitative research included semistructured face-to-face interviews with 25 postgraduate students who were at the writing-up stage of their research. The participants were selected using a purposeful sampling process. Interviews were analyzed using the coding technique of classic grounded theory. The research framework was the Eisenberg and Berkowitz information behavior model. The relationships that are discussed in this article include those between the principle of least effort on the one hand and availability bias and ambiguity aversion on the other; value-sensitive design and reactance; willingness to return and availability bias; library anxiety and ambiguity aversion, status quo bias, and stereotypical bias; information avoidance and selective perception, confirmation bias, stereotypical bias, and conservatism bias; information overload and information bias; and finally, filtering and attentional bias. © 2020 Sara Behimehr et al., published by Sciendo

AB  - This study focused on Information need and behavioral of undergraduate students towards the utilization of e-resources in the selected university of RU and UFH, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Out of the 377 questionnaire copies distributed, 266 copies were returned, giving a response rate of 70.6 percent. The results were analyzed using the Statistical Package of the social Sciences (SPSS Version 32). The results revealed that more males (that is, 119-55.1% respondents), who are within the age bracket of 21 to 30 years old accessed and utilized electronic resources through the residences than their female counterparts. Additionally, Chi-square test of independence was also performed to survey the level of correlation between age and access to E-resources, and the result further revealed that age has no influence on access of respondents to electronic resources through cybercafe. © JHE 2020 Kamla-Raj Enterprises.

AB  - Determining truth and accuracy of information is a key challenge in today's fast-paced, global information economy dominated by social media. The field of Information Science, while publishing extensively on information seeking and use, has not done sufficient research into how individuals detect falsehood or deception in information they encounter. This paper describes Levine's Truth-Default Theory (TDT) and links information behavior (IB) research to three vital aspects of the theory. Furthermore, this work demonstrates how TDT can be merged with T.D. Wilson's General Theory of Information Behavior, applying decades of research on deception detection to foundational IB theory. Implications of marrying these two ideas are discussed as well as suggestions for future research. © 2020, John Wiley and Sons Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most information science (IS) definitions of information center individual rather than collective meaning-making. Because stories are constituted through narrative experience, and audiences are partly constitutive of the stories told to and with them, storytelling offers a framework for researching collective experiences of information. Stories are simultaneously empirical and socially constructed, bridging a key epistemological divide in IS. Storytelling as paradigm shift is explored and demonstrated in three sections that (a) define story and storytelling, (b) describe how story and storytelling can extend the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW) pyramid, and (c) revise DIKW as a new storytelling S-DIKW framework. Future IS storytelling research should account for story and the dynamics of storytelling not merely as a subset of information or of information behavior, but as a fundamental information form. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Information needs motivate human information behavior. Knowledge of information needs is critical for user-centered information behavior research and system design. In consumer health information behavior research, there is a lack of understanding of how consumer health information needs (CHIN) is measured in empirical studies. This study is a systematic review of empirical quantitative studies on CHIN, with a focus on how CHIN is defined and operationalized. A search of six academic databases and citation-track of relevant articles identified a total of 216 relevant articles. These articles were analyzed using the qualitative content analysis method. We found that few included articles explicitly defined either CHIN or information needs in general. When definitions were given, they were from a cognitive perspective and largely ignored the multidimensionality of the concept. Consistent with this cognitive-centered conceptualization, CHIN was operationalized primarily as information topics, with some articles also measuring several additional attributes, including level of importance, fulfilment, amount of information needed, and frequency of needs. These findings suggest that CHIN is undertheorized. To address this gap, future studies should attend to social and emotional dimensions of CHIN, such as motivations, goals, activities, and emotions. Further, more research is needed to understand how CHIN is related to consumer health information seeking behavior and to the social and environmental context in which the needs arise. © 2019

AB  - Two articles in a recent special issue on Information and the Body published in the journal Library Trends stand out because of the way they are identifying, albeit indirectly, a formidable challenge to library information science (LIS). In her contribution, Bates warns that understanding information behavior demands recognizing and studying “any one important element of the ecology [in which humans are embedded].” Hartel, on the other hand, suggests that LIS would not lose much but would have lots to gain by focusing on core LIS themes instead of embodied information, since the latter may be unproductive, as LIS scholars are “latecomer[s] to a mature research domain.” I would argue that LIS as a discipline cannot avoid dealing with those pesky mammals aka patrons or users; like the cognate discipline and “community of communities” human computer interaction (HCI), LIS needs the interdisciplinarity to succeed. LIS researchers are uniquely positioned to help bring together LIS's deep understanding of “information” and embodiment perspectives that may or may not have been developed in other disciplines. LIS researchers need to be more explicit about what their original contribution is, though, and what may have been appropriated from other disciplines. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - This study describes Internet and social media usage among Bangladeshi immigrants in Ontario, Canada. Using a mixed-method approach, the study conducted semi-structured interviews with 60 Bangladeshi immigrants in Ontario and gathered 205 completed survey responses. The findings show that recent Bangladeshi immigrants in Canada significantly depend on the Internet and social media tools in pre-and post-arrival contexts. Specifically, the findings indicate that the use of ethnic community social media forums among the Bangladeshi community are used for help with various aspects of their settlement into Canadian society, including learning about life in Canada, accommodation, and employment. The findings also reveal the important role that social media networking tools like LinkedIn play in recent newcomers’ employment-related decision making and settlement in Canada. The author calls for further studies on immigrants’ use of the Internet and social media—in particular, for studies on ethnic community social media forums and their role in newcomers’ settlement. The author also urges countries welcoming immigrants across the globe such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom to develop timely, need-based, online services for skilled immigrants and their dependents in order to meet the diverse needs of highly skilled immigrant populations. © 2021 The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science.

AB  - Using the Conway model of data science education as a guide, this paper introduces a model for undergraduate data science education for information schools. The core idea of the suggested model is that data science programs in information schools are unique due to their particular substantive expertise, which includes data management, information behavior, and ethics. This paper also suggests that, to create a data science program within an information school, it may be useful to expand curriculums by adding programming, statistics, and machine learning requirements. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Participants in real-time online sessions, be it (business) meetings, virtual school lessons, or social live streams, all engage in cyber social interactions. Unlike parasocial interactions, cyber social interactions are characterized by reciprocity and temporal proximity. In contrast to social interactions, they lack spatial proximity and bodily contact. This is a fairly new concept in information science that rose from technological advances and unprecedented circumstances (e.g., the rise of digital economy and knowledge workers being able to work remotely or, more recently, global lockdowns and contact restrictions). As a result, the past ways of working and socializing were transformed by making them, in some cases predominantly, virtual. Regarding the example of social live streaming we exhibit the importance of cyber social interactions for information behavior research. This conceptual article is a plea for information science to engage more in human-human online relations and interactions. © Wolfgang G. Stock, Kaja J.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how university students assess the credibility of diverse information available on the Web. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used applied study and was conducted using the survey-descriptive method. Using a randomized stratified sampling method and the Cochran sampling formula, a sample including 380 student participants was selected from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran. Data were gathered by administrating a validated questionnaire including eight components of ethics, writing style, website appearance, website identity, professional information, accuracy, usability and interaction. Data were analyzed by software SPSS 20.0 and LISREL 8.7. Findings: Confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling indicated that the overall framework is reliable according to the goodness of fit indices for the measurement and structural models showing a high quality on measuring the variable in the context studied. Findings also showed that the components usability, interaction, accuracy, website appearance, writing style, professional information, ethics and website identity had the standard relevance. Practical implications: Users paid more attention to semantic- and expertise-related features compared to characteristics of the source and its authority. Such preference should be taken into account by providers when producing information and students when evaluating information. Originality/value: The framework underlying this research had the required quality incorporating a set of most important criteria for exploring Web information evaluation behavior by the students, which is also useful for future related studies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has produced numerous deaths throughout the planet, although in general it has been deadlier in older people, in people with previous conditions and in males. The biomedical literature explains the difference in terms of mortality between men and women pointing to genetics and social and cultural reasons. The aim of this work is to explore information behavior, among the other sociocultural variables possibly influencing health outcomes in men and women. For this, we analyze the results of a survey with 95 people administered in Madrid the last week of strict lockdown for Covid-19 (April 2020). Questions were asked about the reasons for using traditional mass media and social media, the use of official and institutional information, the characteristics of the information that was considered useful, and different dimensions of information behavior during lockdown. Results show that the differences between men and women affect certain dimensions of information behavior and especially the information characteristics that are considered useful. Slight differences were also perceived between the two sexes regarding social media, that men appeared to use more for entertainment than communication. © 2021, Universita di Firenze, Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo.

AB  - This study focuses on users of activity tracking technologies and their related information behavior. How useful is the provided information by the trackers? Do users understand all information and explanations? We conducted a web-based survey. All in all, 631 users of a tracking device filled out the survey. From the perspective of information science, this investigation aims to analyze information needs considering different types of the provided information by activity tracking technologies. Are users satisfied by using the information on their steps, heart rates, and sleep duration? How do users assess readability about heart rate zones and sleep stages? Additionally, we investigated if users understand how to reflect on and adapt their health behavior based on the received explanations. According to the results, users mainly agree that the received information (raw data as well as – to a lesser extent – aggregated data in the form of corresponding diagrams) is useful, that the explanations are easy to understand, and that they know how to use this obtained information. This investigation enables an in-depth insight into how users are applying the self-quantifying activity and health information and which information needs are satisfied. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the concept of “literacy” within the new literacy, new literacies and library and information science (LIS) discourses. It proposes widening the prevailing LIS conceptualization of adolescent literacy, which focuses largely on information literacy in academic settings, to a broader, information practice-based, sociocultural framing that encompasses the full range of adolescents’ everyday life contexts. Design/methodology/approach: The author presents a literature review and personal reflection on a series of adolescent information activities to show the value of framing the LIS discourse on adolescent literacy within a broader sociocultural perspective. Findings: Based on the discussion, the author proposes a framework for future investigations of adolescents’ literacy practices that views adolescent literacy as fundamentally social and communicative; multiformat; multicontextual; multigenerational; and culturally situated. Originality/value: A broader sociocultural approach to the LIS information literacy discourse can lead to deeper understanding of the co-constructed and collaborative nature of adolescents’ new literacies practices. It can also enable stronger recognition of the impact of power and privilege on adolescent literacy practices. Finally, this essay shows the value of reflecting on adolescent information activities for challenging narrow views of literacy and highlights the social embeddedness of new literacies activities in adolescents’ everyday lives. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The current big data era has placed new challenges for the study and application of information management (IM). In this paper we visualized how IM evolved over thirty-six years (1980–2015). An author co-citation analysis was applied to a dataset extracted from Web of Science Core Collection®. To map the evolution, a longitudinal perspective was carried out by partitioning three homogeneous sub-periods of twelve years (1980–1991, 1992–2003, and 2004–2015). The 10% of most cited authors in each sub-period were clustered in bibliometric networks and then labeled into research areas. Likewise, we constructed a strategic diagram in order to describe internal relations within clusters and their interactions. Our findings evidenced 14 clusters from 1980 to 2015, representing several topics like management information systems, database systems, library automation, information management foundations, technology-based strategy, information technology management, health information management, personal information management, and motivated information management. The socio-intellectual structure shows a transition from an organizational to an individual approach in the study and application of IM. Our findings also point to an evolution from a technological orientation towards an informational orientation, since in the last sub-period there are mostly information scientists related to the study of information behavior and information retrieval. This study is the most comprehensive bibliometric research oriented to visualize the overall evolution IM. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This conceptual article argues for the value of an approach to privacy in the digital information environment informed by Luciano Floridi's philosophy of information and information ethics. This approach involves achieving informational privacy, through the features of anonymity and obscurity, through an optimal balance of ontological frictions. This approach may be used to modify models for information behavior and for information literacy, giving them a fuller and more effective coverage of privacy issues in the infosphere. For information behavior, the Information Seeking and Communication Model and the Information Grounds conception are most appropriate for this purpose. For information literacy, the metaliteracy model, using a modification a privacy literacy framework, is most suitable. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a new human dynamics model to explain the process of verified users' (VUs) posting on Sina micro-blog. Design/methodology/approach: A common human dynamics research method with three steps is applied. Firstly, a large-scale behavioral dataset is collected involving 495 VUs and five topics on Sina micro-blog. Second, five important indicators that reveal the characteristics of posting behavior are analyzed. Then, a quantitative model is constructed to describe the process of posting behavior, and its validity is verified by simulations. Findings: Three important characteristics of VUs' micro-blog posting behavior are observed: fat-tailed distribution, fluctuation and periodicity. These characteristics do not fit the assumption of interest-driven models proposed by previous literature. An optimized task-driven model is introduced to describe this complex phenomenon mathematically. The model is verified on empirical data, confirming that task-driven models can be optimized to explore information behavior on social media. Originality/value: Being different from previous studies that mainly describe common users' posting behavior on social media by applying interest-driven models, this paper customizes an optimized task-driven model for VUs, who mainly treat social media as a platform for work and play a crucial role in information creation on social media. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This study examines the information practices of Israeli lawyers highlighting the central role that information plays in professional communities of practice. Examining the information practices of lawyers characterizes the information behavior of this community of practice. Design/methodology/approach: Information practices are those recurrent practices related to actively seeking information for a variety of sources socially and contextually situated within members of a professional community. Twenty semi-structured interviews were carried out with lawyers in Israel that investigated the different ways by which lawyers interact with information in their professional work. Data collected in the interviews were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Findings: Findings from the content analysis of the interviews revealed three main themes: information assimilation, networking and self-promotion and content creation that encompass a wide variety of information practices related to seeking information related to a case, preparing and presenting a case, providing support for the client, collaborating with other members of the professional community and promoting their professional practice. Originality/value: This study provides an innovating perspective of the ways by which an information-rich community of practice engages with information, solves problems, build social connections and creates new content. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Using technology to facilitate learning in universities and other higher education institutions (HEIs) has become common practice due to its ability to reduce barriers related to time and space in traditional learning environments. However, current literature mostly focuses on the use of the technology and not on the use of the information it conveys. Also, very few studies focus on technology adoption in universities and HEIs in developing countries, especially those in Africa. Thus, we propose a model that explains the changing information behaviors of students in this digital age and the effect this has on their learning outcomes. We collected questionnaire data from 303 students and analyzed the data using structural equation modelling partial least squares (SEM-PLS). We found that our proposed model explains 60.2 % of student satisfaction, 24.2 % of academic performance, 24.1 % of information sharing, and 19.8 % of their information exchange behavior. This study confirms that the use of digital information and its antecedent factors have significant effects on the college experience of students. This has several implications for information systems research and practice, especially in the design and assessment of technology use in learning environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the information needs of Egyptian doormen/women, including their behaviour. An adapted form of snowball sampling of a heterogeneous demographic group of participants in the doormanship in Egypt was conducted. This sampling was used to select focus groups (n = 6) to explore a range of relevant issues. Demographically, Egyptian doormen/women appeared to be mostly males, with average formal education, with an average age of around 30s and 40s, characterized as low-income people and mostly married. A large number of Egyptian doormen/women suggested that they have not been fully aware of their information rights and a majority of them have not been able to address their information needs in an appropriate way. The study also showed a remarkable diversity in the information needs of doormen/women, particularly concerning the individual and family need, the needs of work-related activities, and the need to find a better place to work in. Regarding their information behavior profile, a large number of doormen/women preferred undocumented oral sources, as well as the frequent informal sources between them and their relatives, peers, and employers, whether through direct interaction, face-to-face meetings, or through mobile and social media. The reasons why doormen/women are searching for information were mostly intended to help in the performance of tasks that are closely associated with their jobs. A large number of doormen/women preferred oral or informal sources over written ones, such as communication with their peers, family, and friends. The experience gained was also one of the most important sources on which doormen/women relied. Time, illiteracy, psychological pressure, bad social image, the lack of awareness of basic and fundamental rights, especially information rights, lack of financial resources, lack of skills and training, and financial burdens were the most important challenges. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - It is widely recognized that affect and cognition can have a profound influence on information behavior. However, how these factors affect information behavior in the context of chronic, stigmatized conditions is less clear. This study employed a qualitative approach to explore the interrelatedness of affect, cognition, and information behavior among persons with fibromyalgia. Persons with fibromyalgia were recruited using multiple recruitment strategies (e.g., listservs and social media) for an interview study. The interview guided participants to tell their story as they drew a timeline. Data were analyzed using qualitative data analysis methods based on the Grounded Theory Methodology. Participants' narratives illustrated that affect and cognition had diverse effects on participants' information and health behaviors: uncertainty and negative affect promoted information seeking; affect and information facilitated reconceptualization and self-growth; and online venues facilitated venting, gave rise to validating experiences, and provided opportunities to help others. This study's findings contribute to extant knowledge by connecting affect, cognition, and action in long-term health management. The study also provides recommendations for practice: a need to focus on practical management strategies in information provision, develop information resources to address the needs of diverse populations, and promote empathy and awareness concerning invisible conditions. © 2021 The Author.

AB  - Patients’ online access to their EHR together with the rapid proliferation of medical information on the Internet has changed how patients use information to learn about their health. Patients’ tendency to turn to the Internet to find information about their health and care is well-documented. However, little is known about patients’ information seeking behavior when using online EHRs. By using information horizons as an analytical tool this paper aims to investigate the information behavior of cancer patients who have chosen to view their EHRs (readers) and to those who have not made that option (non-readers). Thirty interviews were conducted with patients. Based on information horizons, it seems that non-reading is associated with living in a narrower information world in comparison to readers. The findings do not suggest that the smallness would be a result of active avoidance of information, or that it would be counterproductive for the patients. The findings suggest, however, that EHRs would benefit from comprehensive linking to authoritative health information sources to help users to understand their contents. In parallel, healthcare professionals should be more aware of their personal role as a key source of health information to those who choose not to read their EHRs. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Many young adults (particularly LGBTQ+ young people) often do not receive relevant sexual health information in school-based health education classes, leaving them with unmet information needs, which they largely go online in order to fulfill. Meanwhile, information literacy instruction is almost exclusively provided to young adults within an academic context; thus, the knowledge and skills they learn may not be easily adapted to everyday life contexts, including health. In order to learn more about this potential mismatch and to identify potential ways in which we might improve information literacy instruction for this population, I conducted an online survey incorporating LGBTQ+ inclusive language. The results suggest that the most popular online health information evaluation strategies amongst young adults may be unreliable and, while this population may understand more reliable methods, they appear to struggle to apply these “academic” information evaluation skills to their everyday life information seeking, thus suggesting the need for improved and updated information literacy instruction that is more broadly applicable to people's everyday life information needs.

AB  - Ebooks have enthusiastically been adopted by academic libraries, viewed as a golden bullet by library professionals, resulting in efficient resource use, space saving, student satisfaction and accommodating millennial generation study habits. A small-scale online survey undertaken at Northumbria and Durham Universities investigated students’ ebook use, examining aspects of learning ebooks support, searching strategies, devices used for ebook access, and reading and use strategies. Ninety-two responses were analysed using a mixed methods approach. Despite many advantages of ebooks including portability, availability, functionality and searching, results, demonstrated sentiment regarding ebooks was not wholly positive. There were frustrations regarding the complexity of ebook provision, publisher’s restrictions and the lack of compatibility with reading devices. A key finding related to ebook interrogation which involved greater targeted searching of content and a ‘bite-size’ approach to reading. Caution must be observed to ensure that library collections facilitate a complexity of learning styles, and provide opportunities for students to better digest content. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Using cloud storage for collaborative projects has become common practice among researchers. However, despite its popularity, we lack an understanding of researchers' shared file management practices in cloud storage. More importantly, although researchers engage in various shared file management activities (i.e., create, update, organize, find/re-find, keep, archive, and delete) in cloud storage, no studies have comparatively investigated these activities. Based on 475 responses from researchers collected through an online survey, this study examined researchers' different shared file management activities by focusing on the differences in the frequency, perceived ease of use, and satisfaction for each activity, and identified well-supported activities as well as activities that require increased support. This study deepens our understanding of researchers' shared file management practice in cloud storage by cross-examining an array of shared file management activities, and contributes to the development of tools and applications that better support researchers' shared file management in cloud storage.

AB  - The changes in the global mediascape have had a tremendous impact on societal news flows. Using data from the Social Survey Austria 2018 and a quantitative application of the media repertoire approach, the article illustrates how information behavior and news seeking relate to social status, political orientation and sociodemographics. The results confirm that the developments in Austria—often referred to as a representative of a traditional media landscape—are mostly in line with international trends, as new media have been added to the media repertoires of approximately two-thirds of the sample. Effects tied to social inequality generally match previous assumptions: Higher educational achievements and income lead to more diversified news repertoires. Additionally, the overall structure of the data indicates that the online-only users are still a small minority, consisting of younger individuals who are less likely to work and more likely to vote for left-wing parties. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Information behavior describes all human behaviors in relation to information. Individuals experiencing disruption or stigma often use internet-based tools and spaces to meet their associated information needs. One such context is pregnancy loss, which, although impactful and common, has been absent from much of feminist and reproductive health and information behavior scholarship. By understanding information behavior after pregnancy loss and accounting for it in designing internet-based information spaces, we can take a meaningful step toward countering the stigma and silence that many who experience such loss endure, facilitate coping, and make space for diverse pregnancy narratives in our society. Objective: This study's objective is to provide a characterization of internet-based information behavior after pregnancy loss. Methods: We examined internet-based information behavior after pregnancy loss through 9 in-depth interviews with individuals residing in the United States. We analyzed the data by using open and axial coding. Results: We identified the following three themes in relation to participants' information behavior in internet-based spaces: needed information types, information-related concerns, and information outcomes. We drew from information behavior frameworks to interpret the processes and concerns described by participants as they moved from recognizing information needs to searching for information and to using information and experiencing outcomes. Specifically, we aligned these themes with information use concepts from the information behavior literature-information search, knowledge construction, information production, information application, and information effects. Participants'main concerns centered on being able to easily find information (ie, searchability), particularly on topics that had already been covered (ie, persistence), and, once found, being able to assess the information for its relevance, helpfulness, and credibility (ie, assessability). We suggest the following design implications that support health information behavior: Assessability, persistence, and searchability. Conclusions: We examined internet-based information behavior in the context of pregnancy loss, an important yet silenced reproductive health experience. Owing to the prevalence of information seeking during pregnancy, we advocate that generic pregnancy-related information spaces should address the needs related to pregnancy loss that we identified in addition to spaces dedicated to pregnancy loss. Such a shift could not only support those who use these spaces to manage pregnancies and then experience a loss but also help combat the silence and stigma associated with loss and the linear and normative narrative by which pregnancies are often represented. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Today, more than ever, there is an abundance of information and points of access that can complicate the information seeking process, even in religious communities and cultures. People are overwhelmed with information and tend to seek information from those they trust; consequently, individuals are oftentimes blindly trusting these sources. It is important, therefore, to create awareness of misinformation in religious communities/cultures, including ways it can be spread, and the role of critical thinking as a defense against it. This study looks to examine the relation of information literacy within religiously enforced cultures. © 2020, John Wiley and Sons Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of social noise. Under the influence of social noise, a social media user may adjust information behavior based on external cues, attempting to present themselves in a more desirable way to increase their social capital. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study informed by an ethnographic approach was used to examine social media information behavior. Participants were observed using Facebook, followed by semi-structured interviews. Data analysis was theoretically grounded in thematic analysis but also adaptive to observations in the data. Findings: Four constructs of social noise were identified in the data. Identity curation emerged as the overarching consideration for individuals. The constructs cultural commitments and relationship management both had a strong presence within the data as well. The fourth construct, conflict management, was identified as social media users decided how to respond to individuals or information with which they did not agree. Originality/value: This study reveals that social media users' awareness of observation by others does impact their information behavior. Efforts to craft a personal reputation, build or maintain relationships, pursue important commitments and manage conflict all influence the observable information behavior of social media users. As a result, observable social media information behavior may not be an accurate reflection of an individual's true thoughts and beliefs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study examined personal information creation and storage practices in digital and print media by faculty in selected universities in Ghana. A sample survey research design guided the research and quantitative data were collected from 235 faculty members of six universities in Ghana. Qualitative data was also collected from 18 willing faculty members, and was guided by an interview schedule. Faculty reported that they created their information in an organized manner and that they created information mainly in digital formats compared with manual. The task at hand determined the information facility created and search words that are semantically related to the item are used in finding/re-finding electronic information. Faculty reported that they acquired their information literacy personally, and information literacy explained re-finding of digital information but not non-digital information. The demographic variables in the study did not explain finding/re-finding of stored information: gender (β = -0.113, p = 0.280) and age (β = 0.038, p = 0.545). This study establishes clearly the pattern of information literacy activities for faculty in the universities in Ghana.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.

AB  - Animals, specially companion species, are an integral part of our daily homes and cities but have not been the focus of everyday information behavior research to date. The practice of incorporating animals into research is not straightforward because they do not share our language or norms. The question this research aims to answer is: how can the perspective of other animal subjects be incorporated in information behavior research? This preliminary study of four multispecies families, included humans, dogs, and cats in the research design, and a more-than-human perspective was used as a research paradigm, offering different ways of thinking about ethnography and phenomenology methods. Five methodological strategies (speaking for the animal, listening differently, walking and sensing, photography, and technological mediation) proved effective in making the role of animals in the information experience of multispecies family visible. The article concludes with a discussion of the methodological implications that emerge when a researcher claims to view humans as conjoined with other life forms and seeks to include animals in information behavior research. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the information needs and seeking behaviors of African refugees in the Midwest United States. The research also investigates the sources participants consulted and their satisfaction with their information seeking and the information found. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research study recruited 18 African refugees to participate in one or more data collection modes used in the study (questionnaire, interview, focus group). The data were analyzed using qualitative open, axial and selective coding approaches to identify themes. Findings: The analysis of the data collected provides evidence that refugees had specific information needs centered on housing, health care, employment and education. They were not necessarily satisfied with the information they were able to find. Participants reported initially relying heavily on their caseworkers as sources of information when they first arrived in the United States until they were able to establish larger networks of contacts, which then expanded their information behaviors. Research limitations/implications: The number of participants and regional focus of the study do not allow for generalization of the findings to all African refugees in the United States. Still, the findings shed light on how to better serve the information needs of African refugees to help them adjust to life in their new environment. Practical implications: The findings of the study provide guidance for agencies that assist African refugees in adjusting to life in the United States. Originality/value: This study represents one of the few investigations of the information needs and seeking behaviors of African refugees in the United States. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Effective information behaviour is crucial in all translation competence models but our understanding of how information skills develop and how translators interact with information found in online resources is still limited. In this article we focus on information behaviour (needs and use) of bidirectional translators who frequently translate into their native (L1) and their non-native language (L2). The theoretical underpinnings come from information studies: (1) information is needed when cognitive uncertainty arises and–when found–it allows the translator to make an informed decision; (2) translators are driven by economy of effort and will minimise the cost of searching for information. The empirical evidence comes from a study of 30 professional bidirectional translators who translated two texts into their native language of low diffusion (Polish) and into their non-native major language (English). A close analysis of their information behaviour included data obtained by keylogging, eye-tracking and screen recording, and showed that using online resources adds more cognitive effort when translators work into their L2. We use the results to draft a model of information behaviour which shows how the use of online resources is affected by the translation direction. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper explores the information behaviour of repatriated migrants in Bangladesh in the context of their irregular migration. Using an exploratory qualitative research design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight repatriated migrants in Bangladesh. This study provides insights into the culturally situated, complicated information behaviour of repatriated migrants in Bangladesh. The findings of this study show that repatriated migrants did not seek any information in the context of their irregular migration. It is evident that factors such as unrealistic perceptions and expectations about life abroad, desperate desire to relocate to another country, and trust in smugglers and their agents played a key role in their information seeking in the context of their irregular migration. The study revealed that some participants were unaware of the risk of taking an irregular journey and deceived by the misinformation shared by their smugglers and their agents. Some interviewees even claimed not to attempt to move to Malaysia if they were aware of the heavy risks associated with the move. The concepts of "migration as gambling"and "Aladdin's lamp"emerged in this study have some implications for local informational program development aiming to educate vulnerable rural population about the risk of irregular migration and connect them with reliable migrational information sources. The study identified some information grounds such as the Bazaar and Betel fields, which might be useful in offering informational programs at those grounds. The findings related to the information behaviour of repatriated migrants have potential implications for research in various disciplines, including library and information science, migrational studies, geography, and psychology. © 2021 Nafiz Zaman Shuva, published by De Gruyter.

AB  - Purpose: In this paper, we introduce feminist technoscience as an approach that will advance theory in information behavior and practice. Design/methodology/approach: In this conceptual paper, we identify four common assumptions in information behavior and information practice research that limit theory development to date. Existing models and theories tend to rely on extractive logic, focus on a person-in-situation, depend on binary definitions and assume that information interaction changes people's lives for the better. This leads to extractive ways of discussing information interactions and limits our ability to fully theorize embodiment and affect in our discipline. Findings: Feminist technoscience offers distinct ways of thinking about people, technology, bodies and power; in doing so, it responds to some perennial limitations in our research to date. Originality/value: Feminist technoscience is a robust research paradigm that has not yet been fully applied in our discipline. Assumptions in information behavior and information practice research have led to models and theories that reflect a logic of extraction and are limited in their potential for characterizing both embodiment and affect. Feminist technoscience provides a way to conduct research that challenges these assumptions and addresses these limitations. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study aims at establishing the use of smart phones for information seeking by undergraduate students in a Nigerian Specialised University. A descriptive survey design was adopted. Five objectives and five research questions were formulated to guide the study. A stratified random sampling technique was used to select one thousand four hundred and three (1,403) respondents across the two colleges for the study whereas 84% were retrieved. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistical tools such as frequency, percentage and means. The outcome of the study revealed that apple iOS topped the highest types of smart phone used for information seeking by undergraduate students follow by Google android, blackberry, open WebOS, MeeGo, window phone, Symbian and others. The result also, discovered that factors affecting the use of smart phones for information seeking by undergraduate students include poor battery, high rate of theft on campus, lack of technical experts on repairs when faulty within campus, high cost of data subscription/ Internet access, phone crashes, fragility, poor usage skills, unstable power supply for regular charging, among others. The paper concluded that undergraduates students at all levels should be encouraged to use smartphones for academic works and regular training should be conducted for undergraduate’s students on how to maximize access to information using their smart phones. © 2021

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the status quo of digital poverty among adolescents in China, analyze the characteristics and the causes, then propose countermeasures to provide reference for alleviating digital poverty among adolescents. Design/methodology/approach: The study developed an initial scale of digital poverty among adolescents and used survey data to revise the scale, on this basis, formed a questionnaire, which was distributed to nationwide adolescents. The study developed its findings from the 837 valid questionnaire respondents. Findings: The digital poverty among adolescents is mainly shown in the poverty of digital ability, digital psychology and digital environment and presents the following characteristics, that is, insufficient information seeking ability and information selection ability needing to be improved; equipped with basic information awareness but lack of information evaluation ability; lack of patience in obtaining information and inclined to the principle of least effort; imperfect knowledge structure and immature psychological emotions and vulnerable to external interference; having a certain relationship with the information environment, but not significantly affected by regional economic differences. Finally, the study puts forward countermeasures to alleviate digital poverty among adolescents. Practical implications: Understanding of the digital poverty among adolescents will likely demand rethinking into a number of issues ignored by information poverty studies. Originality/value: Few studies focus on digital poverty among adolescents. This study developed an initial scale of digital poverty among adolescents and revised it by survey data, then conducted an empirical study through questionnaire, which could expand the understanding of information poverty in the field of library and information science. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We summarized the various behaviors after switching apps during the mobile search process. We also concluded why people switch apps based on information, personal characteristics, and mobile app features.

AB  - As the use of arts-involved and data visualization methods increases in information science, it is essential to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of various methods. An international lineup of information researchers shares their experiences using the participatory, visual elicitation technique Information World Mapping (IWM) in their work. The authors begin with an overview of IWM, detailing its origins and emerging directions. They summarize their application of IWM to describe information behaviors/practices across various locations, cultures, disciplines, and technology access environments. The authors conclude by discussing key questions and areas of exploration for IWM in information research, including cultural influences, changes in media and methods for data collection, power dynamics, and researcher positionality and reflexivity. Insights offer new possibilities for the next phase of IWM in information research, including challenges and areas for innovation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper aims to introduce the quantitative method named Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS). With this method one can determine the historical roots of research fields and quantify their impact on current research. Using a quantitative method named reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS), this research tried to determine the historical roots of information seeking behavior research. RPYS pave the way for determining the significant years and works in information seeking behavior. The main problem is it can reveal whether Information Seeking Behavior has the same or different impact on these journals in terms of citation. Using scientometrics method, the initial data of this study have been extracted based on ISC Database. The revised data were analyzed and visualized in Excel. The distribution of cited references in information seeking behavior revealed four peaks within 20th century. Moreover, our analysis identified 4 peaks between 1989 and 2000 in the field of information seeking behavior, occurred respectively in 1989, 1993, 1998, and 2000. Based on the study findings, it seems that information seeking behavior research has been shaped intellectually by fields such as library and information science, management, etc. Moreover, it has been influenced by some theories and theoretical works. © 2020, Regional Inform.

AB  - Studies showed that personal experience with censorship can trigger psychological and behavioral resistance in individual users. However, it is still unclear whether this impact goes beyond those who are censored and to those who witness or are made aware of censorship at work. Through a survey of 481 college students in China, this study examined the relationships between censorship exposure, emotions, and information behaviors on sensitive issues online. The result shows that more exposure, though with a modest effect, predicts higher levels of anger and acquisition and production of information on censored topics. Anger itself is also a predictor of higher information acquisition and production, while fear is only negatively related to information production. Implications are made for future research and Internet policy evaluation. © 2022 Policy Studies Organization.

AB  - This paper is an examination of the information behaviors and habits of practising Pagans and ritual magicians. Aspects of information behavior relevant to contemporary Paganism are discussed, before features of Paganism that may affect information needs and use are presented. An online questionnaire covering the six areas of information needs, access, retrieval, quality, use and literacy was administered with 142 respondents, and five of those were subsequently interviewed at length, before the results were analyzed using an interpretivist methodology, with reference to existing information behavior models deemed relevant. The results present the beginning stages of a model of Pagan and Occult information behavior, showing seven sliding scales concerning issues practicing Pagans and ritual magicians face when engaging with information, on which each individual may have very different positions. © Equinox Publishing Ltd 2022, Office 415, The Workstation, 15 Paternoster Row, Sheffield S1 2BX

AB  - Information behavior is an important area of conceptual knowledge for reference service providers, as it provides structure for understanding users’ information seeking and use. This study explores the extent to which information behavior theories, models, and concepts have been integrated into professional education for reference and information service (RIS) through a syllabus study and textbook review. In addition, the study identifies specific information behavior theories, models, and concepts used in introductory RIS courses. Syllabi for introductory RIS courses taught at North American library and information science programs were analyzed for information behavior content, as were the textbooks required by the syllabi. Results show that about two-thirds of introductory RIS courses include instruction in information behavior theories, models, and concepts. Overall, the most impactful information behavior theories and models from the literature are introduced. © Journal of Education for Library and Information Science.

AB  - Purpose: Some virtual, immersive stories are filled with documents that users must locate and interact with to experience a narrative. Exploring a new area of inquiry in the information science field, this study focuses on individuals' experiences with documents in a particular 3D storytelling world. Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative approach, this study examined user interactions with virtual documents to better understand the relationship between information behavior and narrative spaces. This study employed observations of users in a story-rich world, followed by semistructured interviews using virtual artifacts and stimulated recall. Findings: Using an interpretative phenomenological analysis, this study found that (1) environmental and personal influences, (2) the search and the narrative experience and (3) expectation and confirmation events surround a user's experiences with documents in storytelling worlds. These influences and experiences determine the user's relationship with these documents, which may be considered narrative ephemera – objects that a user accumulates to create and structure a story. This model of narrative ephemera depicts the user's search for narrative cadence, fulfillment of competence needs and visions of story events or the user's own lived experiences. Individuals may experience these phenomena from a single document, shifting back and forth between the designers' intentions and the users' own realities. Originality/value: This study represents a first attempt to investigate information behavior in a distributed narrative space: a virtual world filled with documents. This study reveals that commonly employed information behavior theories, as well as literary and motivation theories, may be well suited for investigating story worlds. Continued research in this area of inquiry may benefit educators as well as designers of digital stories. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Facebook and many other social media companies act on information markets with various player groups, which are differentiated by the kind of payment, one group paying with money (normally, advertisers) and the other group paying with their personal data or their attention (i.e., Facebook's users being simultaneously the advertisers’ potential customers). In order to minimize users’ problems with (rather annoying) ads on digital services, some providers offer user settings for the optimization of advertising. We analyzed the information behavior of Facebook users concerning ad settings with the help of an online survey (N = 1,021). Only about 40% of participating Facebook users know about personalization of settings of their advertising preferences. More than 20% of the users who work with Facebook's advertising optimization are satisfied since the changes, but 35% are unsatisfied, and another 32% have a generally negative attitude towards online advertising. To describe customers’ disregard or ignorance of settings we introduce the term “settings blindness.” Especially the users’ gender and their educational background influence the information behavior concerning advertisement settings. The results have practical implications for Facebook users (namely, setting their own preferences for ads and thus seeing only personally customized ads), for Facebook and other social media companies (producing less annoying ads leading to a better customer loyalty and maybe more trust in the service), and for advertisers on social media (improving the correct addressing of the target groups). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The terminological composition of information management (IM) and knowledge management (KM) is described in order to evidence how much do these areas overlap within the library and information sciences (LIS) space. A term co-occurrence analysis is conducted as from documents extracted from Web of Science, covering the period 1980–2015. To examine the terminological (di) similarity two approaches are applied: ‘overlay visualizationʼ and ‘topic detectionʼ. The percentage of terminological similarity oscillates between 24% and 38% according to the ‘overlay visualizationʼ and ‘topic detectionʼ techniques. At the core of the terminological intersection between IM and KM lies the study around processes, technologies and information systems. However, they are semantically two separate areas that tend to address similar dimensions -such as the managerial, educational and medical, but emphasizing different approach. Moreover, IM refers to the library and information organizations, highlighting the focus on personal information management, human information behavior, health information management, and information resource management. Oppositely, KM highlights the business, management and accounting realms in which topics like knowledge sharing and social networks, knowledge management strategies, and knowledge management projects are prevailing. These results would help to (re) define curricular contents of LIS programs as well as research and practical activities conducted by academicians and managers. This is the most comprehensive quantitative study in examining the epistemic borders between IM and KM in the LIS research. The authors consider that the methodological procedures here employed might be suitable to understand the boundaries between similar fields. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This mixed-methods study examined users' information behavior and their perceptions of copresence on Twitch.tv, where millions of people come together live every day to stream, interact, and make their own entertainment. Human information theory model and social identity theory constituted the theoretical framework for this research. Studying topic specific live streaming services is an emerging and exciting field in communication. Topic specific live streaming sites such as Twitch.tv are evolving constantly into important sources of information that complement the traditional information systems such as libraries and online search engine sites like Google. Chat logs of three live streams on Twitch.tv were analyzed using Linguistic Query and Word Count (LIWC) and SPSS statistical tools. Qualitative thematic analysis was carried out using Nvivo 12. Information reaction and production were the most frequent information behaviors across three streams. Qualitative analysis indicated that users within the three live streams showed a great deal of copresence. This study is an important first step to provide theoretical insights into understanding human information behavior on Twitch, topic specific live streaming sites, and social live streaming sites in general. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction. Are viewers of video-on-demand (VoD) services more intrinsically (i.e., preferentially self-determined) or extrinsically (i.e., externally determined) motivated when selecting movies and series? For extrinsic motivation, we distinguish between algorithmically generated suggestions from the services and personal recommendations from other users. Methods. We empirically investigated the information behavior on video streaming services of users from German-speaking countries with the help of an online survey (N = 1258). Results. Active VoD users watch videos online mainly on a daily basis. They are externally determined in the selection of their videos both by algorithmically generated recommendations from the systems and—to a higher extent—from personal suggestions from acquaintances, friends, and relatives. However, there is a clear indication that intrinsic motivation plays a major role in the selection of videos. Discussion. Users of VoD services move in a cycle between machine-generated recommendations, suggestions, and exchange of opinions from and with other people, and self-determined information behavior. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Libraries increasingly offer much of their collection online, rendering it invisible or unavailable to readers who, for reasons of information experience, prefer to browse the shelves. Although the evidence that shelf browsing is an important part of information behavior is increasing, information browsing as a behavior is somewhat of a black box (in contrast to web browsing, which is relatively well understood). It seems likely from early work that browsing is not, in fact, a monolithic behavior, but rather a set of behaviors and goals. The typologies presented in these works, however, are of a too high level to offer much insight into what support is needed for successful online browsing. In contrast, a recent spate of speculative browsing technologies meet some browsing needs, but offer little theoretical understanding of how systems support browsing. The major contribution of this article is a new typology of library browsing behavior based on recent observations of browsing behavior in libraries. The secondary contribution is an understanding of the interface features that would support these types of information browsers in an online environment. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - BACKGROUND: The first step to properly designing image retrieval systems with the aim of meeting the needs of students and researchers is to be fully aware of their behavior in the face of these systems and image resources. The purpose of this study is to identify image retrieval behavior of medical students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is an applied research that has been done by descriptive-survey method. The statistical population of this study is 816 general (clinical) medical students who are studying in the fourth and fifth years. Using Morgan and Krejcie table, the number of statistical sample members was 265 who were selected using random sampling method. Research data have been gathered using a questionnaire (researcher made) and then analyzed using SPSS22 software. RESULTS: The findings showed that 78.1% of students consider the use of images in class presentations or scientific reporting as the most important reason. According to 73.6% of respondents, the highest rate of image search is in the form of videos. About 76.2% of them consider general search engines to be the most common source for receiving images. For this purpose, only 3.8% of students refer to the librarians. Among the databases from which medical images can be obtained, the most well-known source was the Springer website, which 30.6% of respondents were familiar. CONCLUSION: The process of meeting the image-seeking needs is influenced by various individual, social, and other factors. This study can improve this process by providing the necessary suggestions to medical students, for eliminating barriers and problems in accessing reliable resources and visual information they require, to clarify the necessity of promoting technical knowledge to search accurately and to help for finding solutions to medical and treatment educational centers to have access to reliable and up-to-date information. © 2021 Journal of Education and Health Promotion.

AB  - Background Children with migration background and from low socio-economic status are at higher risk for overweight. To determine appropriate media channels to possibly reach children with targeted health information, it has to be considered that the media and information behavior of children has changed during the last decades. Objective We examined the media and information behavior of children in low socio-economic districts, focusing on those with migration background. Methods Fourteen 3 rdgrade classes (n=250 children, 68.0% with migration background) completed a questionnaire regarding their media consumption, which was based on existing validated surveys. Results ≥ 50% of the children watched TV and around 40% used both mobile phones and computers/tablets/internet for ≥1 h/day. Books were the most popular analogue media (61.6% of children), whereas magazines/newspapers and radio (18.4 and 16.0% of children, respectively) were used less frequently. Furthermore, they regularly used internet, TV and their teachers (63.0, 48.8 and 44.8% of children, respectively) as information source. Especially children with compared to those without migration background less likely used the radio (P=0.0002) and their family as information source (P=0.0017). Conclusions Children attending 3 rdgrade class, especially with migration background, can be addressed through digital media rather than the radio. This may help to sustainably support children outside school with targeted health information. © Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie 2021.

AB  - Purpose: Information seeking can be used to make sense of a situation or solve a problem. Information seeking can be considered a coping strategy when facing illness, crisis or other life-changing events. Cancer is a globally occurring, life-threatening disease, and this review aims to provide an overview of the existing literature on the active information seeking behaviour of cancer patients specifically focussing on how active information seeking serves as a coping strategy. Design/methodology/approach: This study adheres to current guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and consequently, thorough literature searches were conducted in four databases: Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus which resulted in 7,179 publications. Following a careful screening process, this systematic review identifies 14 studies on the use of information seeking to cope with cancer. Findings: The included studies consist of both qualitative and quantitative approaches to analysing the use of information seeking to cope with cancer. The included studies have focussed primarily on demographic factors, the impact of affect, information needs, sources and coping strategies. Research limitations/implications: A number of research gaps within library and information science are identified. Bringing research in this field into information science could allow for a greater understanding of information literacy, the use of existing information and the process of information searching when using information seeking to cope with serious illness. Originality/value: This systematic review focusses on how information seeking serves as a coping strategy for cancer patients and provides an overview of the recent literature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Complicating the notion that personal surveillance is always ubiquitous and pervasive, this article investigates the macro-, meso-, and microlevel "gaps"that confound the study of self-tracking. Literature from humancomputer interaction, critical data studies, and archival science, as well as insights from qualitative research by the authors into the long-term value of self-tracking data, is used to expand a typology of "gaps"that exist as part of the activities, behaviors, technologies, and data practices of self-tracking. In this article an emphasis is placed on elucidating microlevel accountable and expressive gaps, articulating how people respond to and make sense of the temporal absences in their own self-tracking data. In the process, the authors argue for self-tracking research to reorient from a perspective that seeks to mitigate all data gaps to one in which data gaps are viewed as an opportunity to connect individuals with meaningful changes in the patterns of life.  © 2021 by the University of Texas Press.

AB  - This mixed-method study investigated the processes of making and information behavior as integrated in self-directed learning in a high school maker class. Twenty students engaged in making projects of their choice with low- and high-technologies for 15 weeks. Data collection included visual process mapping activities, surveys, and Dervin's Sense-Making Methodology-informed interviews. Findings included inspirations, actions, emotions, challenges, helps, and learning that occurred during the making processes. Information played an integral role as students engaged in creative production and learning. Students identified information as helps, challenges, how they learn, and learning outcomes. The study proposes a new, evolving process model of making that illustrates production-centered information behavior and learning. The model's spiral form emphasizes the non-linear and cyclical nature of the making process. Squiggly lines represent how the making process is gap-filled and uncertain. The study contributes to the scholarly and professional fields of information science, library and information studies, maker, and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) learning. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - This article introduces the generic Document Towers paradigm, visualization, and software for visualizing the structure of paginated documents, based on the metaphor of DOCUMENTS-AS-ARCHITECTURE. The Document Towers visualizations resemble three-dimensional building models and represent the physical boundaries of logical (e.g., titles, images), semantic (e.g., topics, named entities), graphical (e.g., typefaces, colors), and other types of information with spatial extent as a stack of rooms and floors. The software takes as input user-supplied JSON-formatted coordinates and labels of document entities, or extracts them itself from ALTO and InDesign IDML files. The Document Towers paradigm and visualization enable information systems to support information behaviors other than goal-oriented searches. Visualization encourages exploration by generating panoramic overviews and fostering serendipitous insights, while the use of metaphors assists with comprehension of the representations through the application of a familiar cognitive model. Document Towers visualizations also provide access to types of information other than textual content, specifically by means of their physical structure, which corresponds to the material, logical, semantic, and contextual aspects of documents. Visualization renders documents transparent, making the invisible visible and facilitating analysis at a glance and without the need for physical manipulation. Keyword searches and other language-based interactions with documents must be clearly expressed and will return only answers to questions asked; by contrast, visual observation is well suited to fuzzy goals and uncovering unexpected aspects of the data. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: This paper seeks to disambiguate the phenomenon by clarifying terms, highlighting current efforts, including the importance of critical thought and awareness, and a test for genuine serendipity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors review the literature, primarily from a library and information science perspective, and arrive at a theoretical framework and model. Findings: The authors find various initiatives to fight fake news. Building upon Karlova and Fisher's (2013) model as well as research on critical thinking and serendipity, the primary contribution of the paper is a disinformation behavior framework and model. The model includes both the problem of disinformation from a creator and user perspective, as well as the solutions to fight it. Research limitations/implications: The framework will guide practitioners and researchers in library and information science and beyond, as well as other stakeholders in both understanding the phenomenon, and leading the fight against it. Originality/value: The spreading of false information has become an alarming phenomenon in the last few years, leading to the popularity of terms such as misinformation, disinformation, infodemic and fake news. While information professionals have been called upon to lead the fight against fake news, in the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon, current efforts have been isolated and inadequate. Most models of information behavior deal with information, and not misinformation or disinformation per se. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increased focus on information encountering and serendipity within information behavior research and practice. Serendipity has the potential to facilitate creativity and innovation in various spheres, including in libraries, archives and museums. However, do we wait for chance to occur, or can serendipity be designed and facilitated? What are the characteristics of systems that support serendipitous discovery, and what methods can be used to study its occurrence? Extending and building on the concepts and definitions introduced at a 2016 ASIS&T Annual Meeting panel led by Erdelez, we feature in this 40-min panel innovative work that creates opportunities for discovery within research spaces. Attendees engage through an interactive two-part discussion and a hands-on ideation session on impacts and guidelines for systems designed to facilitate serendipity, emphasizing sustainable, accessible researcher and user experiences. Presenters focus on the role of socio-technical constraints and affordances to inform systems' design in a variety of research contexts, each contributing expertise in navigating particular issues in serendipity research. © 2020, John Wiley and Sons Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Pakistan is a developing country where one of the rapidly growing diseases is diabetes. Well-informed diabetic patients are expected to improve the quality of life, self-care behaviors and better cooperation with the health care team. The present study is designed to investigate the information behavior of diabetic patients, and to investigate the role of one institution that is working for diabetes management, treatment, education and counseling in Pakistan i.e. Diabetic's Institute Pakistan (DIP). Design/methodology/approach: The “Embedded Design” based on the mixed methods research approach was adopted to carry out the current research. The study was mainly based on quantitative research design, quantitative data were collected through an adapted questionnaire, the supportive/supplementary qualitative data was collected through an in-depth interview of the medical director, observation record sheets and analysis of the available relevant documents i.e. prescription (prescription notepad with information), brochure and the website was applied. Findings: Diabetic patients want to know about how to control diabetes and mostly rely on humans particularly health professionals and interpersonal networks. The use of books, journals, seminars, libraries is comparatively low. It is an important finding that health-related information is mostly required in national language by Pakistani patients. Lack of computer literacy and information overload were among the barriers that were reported by diabetic patients. Practical implications: Health information seeking channels, formats and language preferences should be considered to design patients' cantered information services. Health information service providers i.e. government, health practitioners, health-related institutions and libraries should work in a liaison for creating health awareness. Identified barriers faced by diabetic patients are important to consider for designing health-related information services. Originality/value: Investigating health information behavior is crucial particularly of the patients from developing countries. The study is first of its kind that is reported from Pakistan. The results of the study may help libraries, health professionals and diabetes-related organizations to design patient's centered policies and information-based services. These institutions may work together to create awareness and to help patients in managing their disease. The study findings are maybe helpful for other developing countries also. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The study reported in this paper is part of an ongoing project that aims to advance the understanding of older migrants' information behavior in transition and their resilience in leveraging information and technology to achieve social integration into a new country. Through the lens of transition theory, this research investigates the information behavior of Chinese migrants to Australia at an older age (i.e., late-life migrants), which is little reported in the migrant information behavior literature. Older Chinese migrants' transition process entailed disconnectedness from previous information practices, perceptions of marginalization and having limited access to resources in English, and construction of new/extended information landscape by participating in ethnic associations and using WeChat for communication. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

AB  - The goal of this exploratory paper is to begin to explicate the concept of epistemicide and articulate its function within the information field. We define epistemicide as the killing, silencing, annihilation, or devaluing of a knowledge system. It is not that we are unaware of the injustices happening within our field, but rather, that we are not in discussion across sub-fields considering the idea that the collective injustices exist and are problematic on individual and systemic levels. We believe epistemicide happens when several epistemic injustices, such as hermeneutical or testimonial injustices, occur collectively reflecting a structured and systemic oppression of particular ways of knowing. We present epistemicide and epistemic injustice as a concept for understanding and addressing ways knowledge systems are silenced, devalued, or annihilated within library and Information Science (LIS). 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

AB  - This paper explores the information behavior of parents with regard to their young school-age children (PreK and elementary school) during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to contribute to research on parent information behavior more generally and to increase our understanding of parent information behavior during this pandemic. This study proposes a model of the influences on parents’ emotional responses to their children’s required daily academic activities following roughly two months of school closures. It is unknown when the pandemic will end; thus this paper recommends solutions that schools might implement to improve parents’ experiences with information as school disruptions continue. © 2020, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to recognize the challenge of identifying deceptive information and provides a framework for thinking about how we as humans negotiate the current media environment filled with misinformation and disinformation. Design/methodology/approach: This study reviews the influence of Wilson’s (2016) General Theory of Information Behavior (IB) in the field of information science (IS) before introducing Levine’s Truth-Default Theory (TDT) as a method of deception detection. By aligning Levine’s findings with published scholarship on IB, this study illustrates the fundamental similarities between TDT and existing research in IS. Findings: This study introduces a modification of Wilson’s work which incorporates truth-default, translating terms to apply this theory to the broader area of IB rather than Levine’s original face-to-face deception detection. Originality/value: False information, particularly online, continues to be an increasing problem for both individuals and society, yet existing IB models cannot not account for the necessary step of determining the truth or falsehood of consumed information. It is critical to integrate this crucial decision point in this study’s IB models (e.g. Wilson’s model) to acknowledge the human tendency to default to truth and thus providing a basis for studying the twin phenomena of misinformation and disinformation from an IS perspective. Moreover, this updated model for IB contributes the Truth Default Framework for studying how people approach the daunting task of determining truth, reliability and validity in the immense number of news items, social media posts and other sources of information they encounter daily. By understanding and recognizing our human default to truth/trust, we can start to understand more about our vulnerability to misinformation and disinformation and be more prepared to guard against it. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: “Bouncing ideas” is a phrase used colloquially to illustrate a way of advancing ideas in the workplace. While described by some as a key part of their information work, it has remained largely unexplored in the information science literature. As a metaphor used to depict information work, it describes a process of working on ideas in conjunction with others. This paper examines how early career academics use the term when describing their academic work. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports on one of the findings from a larger, in-depth study that examined the information behaviour of early career academics undergoing career transitions, which was carried out using constructivist grounded theory (CGT). CGT provides both a framework for the systematic collection (that included multiple interviews and check-ins with 20 early career academics) and analysis of the data (that consisted of multiple rounds of iterative, inductive coding). Findings: The findings identify the component parts of bouncing ideas, which include three component in-formation activities – information seeking, information sharing and information creation – and are undertaken as cooperative information work (joint work for a shared purpose, but the benefits of the work may not be equal between participants). Originality/value: Bouncing ideas is proposed as a complex information practice, defined as engaging in a temporary cooperative effort that involves social information exchange in order to gain help and/or support for an intellectual endeavour to create new information. The work identifies that more research into bouncing ideas is needed to more fully explore the distinct component behaviours that take place whilst bouncing ideas and the social conditions that foster this collaborative exchange. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The health crisis brought about by Covid-19 has generated a heightened need for information as a response to a situation of uncertainty and high emotional load, in which fake news and other informative content have grown dramatically. The aim of this work is to delve into the understanding of fake news from the perspective of information behaviour by analysing a sample of fake news items that were spread in Spain during the Covid-19 health crisis. A sample of 242 fake news items was collected from the Maldita.es website and analysed according to the criteria of cognitive and affective authority, interactivity, themes and potential danger. The results point to a practical absence of indicators of cognitive authority (53.7%), while the affective authority of these news items is built through mechanisms of discrediting people, ideas or movements (40.7%) and, secondarily, the use of offensive or coarse language (17.7%) and comparison or reference to additional information sources (26.6%). Interactivity features allow commenting in 24.3% of the cases. The dominant theme is society (43.1%), followed by politics (26.4%) and science (23.6%). Finally, fake news, for the most part, does not seem to pose any danger to the health or safety of people – the harm it causes is intangible and moral. The author concludes by highlighting the importance of a culture of civic values to combat fake news. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Cognitive biases can influence human information behaviour and decisions made in information behaviour and use. This study aims to identify the biases involved in some aspects of information behaviour and the role they play in information behaviour and use. Twenty-five semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted in an exploratory qualitative study with graduate (MA and PhD) students who were at the stage of their dissertation/thesis research. Eisenberg & Berkowitz Big6TM Skills for Information Literacy was adopted as a framework for interviews and the analysis was done using grounded theory coding method. The findings revealed the presence of twenty-eight biases in different stages of information behaviour, including availability bias (affects the preference for information seeking strategies), attentional bias (leads to biased attention to some information), anchoring effect (persuades users to anchor in special parts of information), confirmation bias (increases the tendency to use information that supports one's beliefs), and choice-supportive bias (results in confidence in information seeking processes). All stages of information seeking were influenced by some biases. Biases might result in a lack of clarity in defining the information needs, failure in looking for the right information, misinterpretation of information, and might also influence the way information is presented. © Natsuki Kadowaki, Kazuaki Kishida, 2020.

AB  - There is a dearth of information behavior research employing a community-engaged approach. This research takes the concept of community engagement as its central focus, reviewing its proximal use in information behavior research and arguing its potential as an integrative process that can restore and reposition the community-researcher relationship in the information behavior field. The “why – what – how” of undertaking community-engaged information behavior (CEIB) research were elaborated and a methodological framework was developed based on these discussions. The CEIB methodology introduced advances a new approach to study human-information interactions, consisting of principles and core components and characteristics of CEIB research that moves beyond the one-sided, researcher-led information behavior study. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - When searching for information on the Internet, it can be stored in a bookmarking system. The ability to organize this information in such a system depends on one’s own prior knowledge to create an appropriate classification scheme. Providing a classification system for bookmarks might support people with low prior knowledge. Even though different bookmarking systems exist, hierarchical menus and tagging are being most widely used. In the current exploratory study with 95 ninth-grade students, a 2 × 2 between-subjects design was used to investigate the influence of providing classification support (or not) for either a tagging or a hierarchical system. Results showed that despite the low familiarity with tagging systems, using a hierarchical system is not necessarily a better approach than using a tagging system to organize previously found information. Rather, a tagging system seems to yield storage of fewer but higher-quality information sources. The most important conclusion is that, despite the low familiarity with tagging systems, using a hierarchical system was not beneficial over using a tagging system to organize previously found information. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - With the increasing disclosure of public information and government data through information and communication technologies, along with the considerable privately generated data now available online, individuals have access to a huge volume of information. This “disintermediation” of (i.e., greater direct access to) public information may improve transparency and facilitate citizen engagement, but it may also overwhelm citizens not only with too much information but also by requiring them to take responsibility for gathering, assembling, and processing information. Despite the importance of effective information processing to successful use of available information, existing studies have not yet fully integrated this consideration into research on citizen use of e-government and open government data. Based on information processing theory—according to which individuals have a finite information processing capacity, which is affected not only by the quantity and quality of information but also by one's preferences for how information is presented—this study examined the effects of information presentation type (infographic versus text) on perceived information overload, along with the consequent effect of information overload on perceived website usefulness. We also investigated whether individual information processing propensity (visual or verbal) moderated the effect of information presentation type on perceived information overload. Our results showed that textual information tended to cause greater information overload, especially for those with a propensity for visual information processing, and that higher information overload was associated with a lower perception of website usefulness. Moreover, individual information propensity moderated the effect of information type on perceived information overload; people with visual information processing propensity were more strongly affected by the presentation of textual information.

AB  - Expectant mothers use various information resources when making health decisions. Resources include health professionals, eHealth resources, printed materials, family and friends. Pregnancy and parenting are times of constant change, driving information needs and are considered a context-rich area in which to study information behaviour. This exploratory research study examines what health-related information resources expectant mothers seek, how they process and utilise them. One key contribution of this research is a classification of Information Use, which includes three types: 1) Information Use as Access, 2) Information Use as Processing, and 3) Information Use as Outcomes. Leveraging this classification, we design and distribute an exploratory questionnaire. The results highlight that health professionals and eHealth resources are the most used and influential information resources for expectant mothers. The article also presents a list of criteria used to evaluate eHealth resources. Finally, we highlight the cognitive, affective, and behavioural information use outcomes experienced by expectant mothers. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: This paper presents findings from a study that explored why and how long-settled immigrants, their descendants and family members seek and use information about their country of origin and how they manage personal information about their cultural heritage legacy. Design/methodology/approach: 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants from the Croatian community in New Zealand. Findings: The main findings reveal two categories of information needs related to a home country: internally motivated and externally motivated. Information is accessed through a network of family and friends, cultural societies and embassies. These information sources are perceived as reliable and trustworthy, and able to offer an interpretation of information along with access to information. The findings highlight the value of personal collections as information sources and the impact of personal information management practices on preserving and sharing information about one's cultural heritage. Originality/value: This article contributes to the discussion about information needs and practices of immigrant communities by offering arguments that focus on (1) long-settled immigrants, their descendants and family members, and (2) seeking information about home country culture and heritage, and (3) the role of personal collections and personal information management in maintaining personal cultural heritage. The results of this study may be of use to libraries, archives and museums in designing and offering their services to expatriates of their country and immigrants in their country, and to the wider information management sector developing services in personal information management. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The practice of reference and information service (RIS) should be based on an understanding of how users seek information to fill information needs and of what they do with that information once they have found it. RIS professional education, therefore, should provide students with a strong grounding in information behavior. This study explores if and how information behavior theories and models are integrated into basic RIS courses in North American Master’s programs, building on the results of a previous syllabus study. Interviews with sixteen instructors, including full-time and adjunct faculty, revealed a range of opinions about the importance of information behavior theories and models in RIS coursework, as well as student receptivity to theories and models. The insights of the instructors and the rich detail provided by the interview method help to contextualize previous studies about information behavior content in RIS professional education. © Journal of Education for Library and Information Science 2022

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article is to identify design guidelines for online resources based on the subjective assessment criteria used by individuals to assess and process information resources. This method of creating design guidelines targeted at precise user groups has the potential to aid designers and developers to create more user-centred information resources. Design/methodology/approach: The authors gathered data using a prospective longitudinal study investigating the information behaviour of expectant and new mothers. Women were asked to report on their information-seeking activities in a series of semi-structured interviews covering pregnancy and early motherhood. Findings: This research identified 15 assessment criteria that were utilised by women to assess and process information resources. The most popular resource criteria amongst participants were credibility and convenience, while completeness and relevance were the most popular information content criteria. The authors found that assessment criteria were not considered in isolation, with criteria such as formatting and search engine ranking impacting on participants' perception of other criteria. Practical implications: This research demonstrates the potential of linking a user groups subjective assessment criterion to design guidelines. The authors propose that these guidelines could be used to help design an online information resource. They could also be used to assess if an existing online resource met the needs of a user group. The methodology used in this study could be leveraged to create design guidelines for user groups. Originality/value: This research uses subjective assessment criteria as a means of understanding how expectant new mothers process information resources. People use subjective judgements when processing information resources, and this should be incorporated into the design of information resources. Analysing longitudinal data allowed the authors to build a rich picture of how participants evaluated and compared different information resources. © 2021, Carolanne Mahony, Ciara Heavin and David Sammon.

AB  - This paper presents the findings of a study exploring the information practices of members of a religious organization. Its focus is the “Mahamevnawa Buddhist Monastery.” Particularly, this paper focuses on the study's findings in relation to participants' information practices in constructing their understanding of “the Temple.” The study is informed by an information practices theoretical perspective, drawing on work from a variety of disciplines, including Castells' space of flows, and Fisher's information grounds. Data was gathered from participant observation, interviews with both monks and devotees and email follow-ups, and analysis of the online presence of the temple through its website. Five social constructs for the temple appear frequently in the interviews: Virtual space; Physical/geographical place; Virtual space; Symbol; Process and practices; and Organization. Participants' information practices are not only limited to spiritual purposes but also are linked to various social practices, activities, and interests. The study's findings suggest that constructions of place play a hitherto underexplored role in the multi-layered relationship between people and information. © 2021 Pethigamage Perera et al., published by Sciendo

AB  - Purpose: Immigration dominates much of the current US sociopolitical discourse. The research on US-based immigrant information behavior, however, remains scant. To understand the role of information in immigration, this study explores information overload among Black immigrants in the US. Design/methodology/approach: The researcher developed a literature-derived information overload scale to investigate participants' information access along with experiences and response to information overload. Findings: Results suggest that participants experience information overload due to behavioral (e.g. the demands of needing, seeking, or using information), quantitative (i.e. volume or length), and qualitative (e.g. authority, diversity, or urgency) indicators. Most participants mitigate information overload by turning to intermediaries and filtering resources. Research limitations/implications: The information overload scale can advance knowledge of the role of information in immigrant acculturative stress. Social implications: LIS researchers and practitioners can utilize findings to foster social inclusion and well-being among immigrants. Originality/value: Scholarship on immigrant information behavior must reflect the centrality of information in migration and how it shapes integration and acculturation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The paper examines information practices of five projects that emerged in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The projects are conceptualized as resistance projects, i.e., the initiatives that stand against misinformation, censorship, and the invasion itself. The study used virtual ethnography and discourse analysis to examine the projects' web presence and social media channels and the materials about them. The paper describes the driving forces behind the projects, the technologies they use, and their information-related practices. The latter include information gathering, dissemination and mediation, extralinguistic communication, support and advice, and mobilization. One of the first attempts to document Russian information resistance, this paper provides insight into information behavior under oppressive conditions. It broadens the theorizing of misinformation and disinformation by shifting the focus from algorithmic countermeasures to misinformation, such as detecting bots or fake news, to human-centered activism.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of wearable health and fitness trackers in everyday life, and users’ motivations and their understanding and use of the data derived from devices, and understand the results using the lens of information behaviours. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a qualitative, constructionist approach, based on 21 interviews with users of a range of wearable activity trackers used for health and fitness. Findings: Findings show that the lifelogging devices have become companion tools that enable users to take information from their bodily indicators and make some decisions about their health and fitness, and also track the results when they act on it, thus giving them a sense of gratification and a sense of control over their own health. Practical implications: The findings have implications on how health professionals can talk to their lifelogging patients about how to deal with and understand the information provided by their activity-tracking devices. Some participants in the study already discuss these data regularly with their health professionals. Originality/value: As the self-tracking practices attract wide range research interests from human–computer interaction, information systems, digital sociology, health informatics and marketing among others. This study provides important everyday information-seeking perspective that contributes to the understanding of the practices of how people make sense of the data, how the data improves their wellbeing, i.e. physical health improvement or fitness, and implications to users health behaviour. Additionally the study adds to the lifelogging literature through a constructionist, qualitative approach rather than a technological deterministic approach. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Long distance hikers' information practices are considered via an ‘in-field’ methodology that generated rich experiential data. Participants documented and reflected on their experiences and use of mobile digital technology while undertaking a two-week coast-to-coast walk across the Scottish Highlands. Empirical evidence on the adoption and use of mobile digital technology by backpackers, and the implications this has for their practices and interactions is scarce. “Research in the Wild” (RITW) mixed methods facilitated exploration of how and why mobile digital technology is employed via analysis of in-field video-logs, interviews with eight participants, and a survey. Analysis of the research interview data provides insights into fieldwork participants' reactions to, and experiences with, the methods employed. The affordances and issues of the approach are discussed, highlighting the benefits and challenges of mixed methods for Human Computer Interaction and Information Behavior research in the arena of outdoor recreation. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Information behavior for health and fitness have attained increasing attention in the e-health field. However, mobile users still need exploring a largely untapped resource on fitness apps to obtain more health benefits. Regarding that prior studies seldom focused on which factor hinders fitness app exploration, this study proposes a moderated mediation model to investigate the mechanisms underlying users’ intention to explore fitness apps (IEFA) based on status quo bias theory and goal-setting theory. This model stresses on the mediation effect of perceived need and the moderating effect of health goal. Data from 346 respondents in China were used to examine the hypotheses proposed in the research model and further to verify the moderated mediation model. The results indicate that users’ inertia negatively influences both perceived need and IEFA, and perceived need not only has a positive influence on IEFA, but also mediates the relationship between inertia and IEFA. In addition, health goal weakens the relationships between inertia and perceived need as well as between inertia and IEFA. This study extends the knowledge of information behavior in the mobile health field and enriches literature of status quo bias and health goal-setting. It also discusses practical implications for fitness app providers. © 2020

AB  - Purpose: The purpose is to provide insight into the social media related information behaviours of Muslim women within Arab society, and to explore issues of societal constraint and control, and impact on behaviours. Design/methodology/approach: The study conducted semi-structured interviews with Muslim women resident within the capital city of a nation within the Arabian Peninsula. Findings: Social media provides the study participants' with an important source of information and social connection, and medium for personal expression. However, use is constrained within sociocultural boundaries, and monitored by husbands and/or male relatives. Pseudonym accounts and carefully managed privacy settings are used to circumvent boundaries and pursue needs, but not without risk of social transgression. The authors provide evidence of systematic marginalisation, but also of resilience and agency to overcome. Self-protective acts of secrecy and deception are employed to not only cope with small world life, but to also circumvent boundaries and move between social and information worlds. Research limitations/implications: Findings should not be considered representative of Muslim women as a whole as Muslim women are not a homogenous group, and Arabian Peninsula nations variously more conservative or liberal than others. Practical implications: Findings contribute to practical and conceptual understanding of digital literacy with implications for education programmes including social, moral and intellectual aspects. Originality/value: Findings contribute to conceptual and practical understanding of information poverty, evidencing structural inequalities as a major contributory factor, and that self-protective information behaviours, often considered reductive, can also be expansive in nature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: In Germany, general secondary education offers few opportunities for young adults to acquire knowledge and understanding of personal finance. Hence, apart from parents’ influence as role models, important influences on young adults’ financial knowledge and understanding likely include their personal experience with financial products and their behavior of informally seeking information about specific financial products. Methods: In this paper, we investigate the relationships between these latter variables based on a sample of 1108 young adults from Germany, aged 17–25, beginning their studies in higher education. Knowledge and understanding of personal finance was assessed using the German adaptation of the US Test of Financial Literacy. In this paper, we focus on the dimension ‘Banking’ (covering financial investing, saving, using credit). In addition, we surveyed young adults’ experience in basic personal finance matters (e.g., having a bank account, using a credit card, paying for rent) and their information behavior towards specific financial products (e.g., stocks, investment, retirement plans, and insurance). Results: The data set was prepared through multiple imputation and analyzed using regression models. The results show clear correlations between knowledge and understanding in the dimension ‘Banking’ and both experience and information behavior in personal finance matters. Conclusions: Our findings illustrate how important it is that young adults obtain experience with and actively inform themselves about financial products, particularly in countries such as Germany where personal finance is not taught extensively and systematically in school. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the Covid-19 crisis at the level of individual information behavior among citizens from the German-speaking countries, Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted among 308 participants gathered through convenience sampling in April and May 2020, focusing on how citizens changed their mix and usage intensity of information sources and according to which criteria they chose them during the Covid-19 crisis. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for testing central tendencies. Effect sizes were considered to support the interpretation. Findings: The results show first that the Covid-19 crisis has led to an increased demand for reliable information. This goes alongside a significant increased use of public broadcasting, newspapers and information provided by public organizations. Second, the majority (84%) of the participants reported being satisfied with the information supply during the Covid-19 crisis. Participants who were less satisfied with the information supply used reliable sources significantly less frequently, specifically public television, national newspapers and information provided by public organizations. Third, the amount of Covid-19-related information led some participants to a feeling of information overload, which resulted in a reduction of information seeking and media use. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to analyze changes of information behavior patterns of individuals during crises in the current information environment, considering the diversity of resources used by individuals. © 2021, Stefan Dreisiebner, Sophie März and Thomas Mandl.

AB  - A rapid increase in the use of web-based technologies – and corresponding changes in government and local council policies – in recent years, means that many vital services are now provided solely online. While this has many potential benefits, it can place additional burdens on certain demographic groups, some of whom may become considerably disadvantaged or even disenfranchised. This is particularly problematic for English-as-a Second Language (ESL) speakers, who are often immigrants or refugees and thus have a greater need to access these e-government services, and who may struggle to understand and assess the relevance of complex documents. In this work we investigate the search behaviours and performance of native English speakers and two different groups of ESL speakers when completing e-government tasks, and the effect of document readability/complexity. In contrast with previous work, our results show significant differences between groups of varying language proficiency in terms of objective search performance, time on task, and self-perceived performance and confidence. We also demonstrate that document reading level moderates the effect of language proficiency on objective search performance. The findings contribute to our existing understanding of how English language proficiency affects search for e-government topics, and have important implications for the future development of e-government services to ensure more equitable access and use. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine the relationships between different uses of Internet modes and political participation, focusing on political information behaviors, including political information seeking and forwarding. Design/methodology/approach: This study used secondary data from the 2016 Korea Media Panel Survey conducted with 8,439 Korean adults. Findings: The results indicated that political participation is generally associated with the use of online news forums, online communities, online services and online information production, but not with the use of social networking sites (SNSs). Additional analyses revealed that the use of different Internet modes has an indirect effect on voting intention through political information seeking. The analysis also showed that a number of sociodemographic characteristics influence political participation. Originality/value: As one of the first studies to focus on active information behaviors in examining the influence of Internet use, this study enhances the understanding of how human behaviors are shaped by digital technology. By providing guidelines for the use of different modes of the Internet, the findings of this study also have practical implications for efforts to encourage political participation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Preparing future information professionals includes educating them about relevant theories and models. This study explores the extent to which education for information services draws on information behavior theories, models, and concepts, particularly how instructors' choices influence the integration of information behavior into their basic reference course. Building on previous research that analyzed the syllabi and readings for basic reference courses, this study used semi-structured interviews to explore how information behavior may be integrated into courses in ways that are not visible in the syllabus and why certain theories were more likely to be presented in the course. The 17 instructors interviewed included tenure-track faculty, lecturers, and adjuncts who integrated information behavior theories, models, and concepts to varying degrees in their courses. By showing how choices are made to integrate theories, models, and concepts in LIS courses, the study results may inform both researchers and instructors who week to bridge the theory/practice gap. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

AB  - Purpose: Everyday life information seeking (ELIS) is essential for the mastery of life and plays a central role in the daily problem-solving activities of all human beings. This study aimed to investigate the everyday life information seeking of female university students residing at hostels in Lahore, Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research approach using a survey method was adopted to identify the dimensions of ELIS and to fill the paucity of research on the topic. Two-hundred and forty-eight female students living in various university and private hostels in Lahore, Pakistan, were surveyed, and the collected data was analyzed using Statistics Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. Findings: Results of the study revealed that hostel living expanded the social circle of students, as it offered exposure to diverse multicultural social groups. Female students living in hostels required information related to their academic needs, safety concerns, social life, and self-help issues. They relied mainly on mobiles phones, the internet, social media, and inter-personal relationships for everyday information. Cultural differences, natural hesitation, language barriers, time concerns, and difficulty in identifying reliable information were the primary obstacles in meeting everyday life information needs. Originality/value: The findings of this study can be used as a premise for developing interventions and information services for female students that allow them to live comfortably in a safe environment in hostels and achieve their educational goals. The study results may also provide useful insights for university administrations to establish libraries in hostels to better cater to their female residents’ information needs. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study explored political information behavior of citizens residing in a rural setting from the district of Toba Tek Singh, Punjab-Pakistan. Qualitative research design using an unstructured interview guide was employed to conduct this research. Face-to-face interviews of 51 participants, selected through purposive sampling process, were conducted for data collection by visiting their homes using local language. Each participant was informed of his responses at the end of the interview for data verification and authentication. Each interview was carefully recorded and transcribed. Using thematic analysis, the verbal data were analyzed and multiple responses were grouped together and reduced into ‘information needs’ and ‘information channels.’ After that, the frequencies and percentages of the responses against these themes were counted because it was possible due to the uniformity in the qualitative data. The results indicated that a large majority of these participants were politically ignorant and did not seem to be in need of political information. A good number of participants required political information on current affairs, rural development policies, government policies and decisions, and both local and national political news. They mainly depended on mass media particularly television for political information followed by newspapers, radio, and interpersonal relationships. Since the rural dwellers were not interested in political information due to political ignorance and backwardness, efforts should be made to improve their political awareness. There was a critical need to evaluate the effectiveness and appropriateness of the existing information infrastructure for the rural population in Pakistan. The results will assist the policy makers in the development of a need-based, unified, and integrated rural information delivery system. This research would make a worthy contribution in existing research on information needs and seeking behavior of rural communities as no such study found addressing directly rural citizens’ political information behavior. © 2020, Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - The increase in online social exchange of health information has raised concerns among information and health professionals about the quality and accuracy of the information exchanged. This study investigates how mothers exchange pregnancy- and parenting-related information in online communities. Through a meta-synthesis, we encoded 31 themes and 9 core themes based on the findings from 39 relevant studies, and observed a general pattern of information exchange in mothers' online communities. We found that mothers behave normatively and have a common perception of information values in the community. We also found interactions between mothers' online communities, offline communities, and lifeworld. The study's findings align with the theory of Information Worlds. The current meta-synthesis sheds light on the practice of health care provision and information service and points toward future empirical research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study investigates the attitudes and practices of Chinese early career researchers (ECRs) in regard to all scholarly aspects, providing the findings in the context of the academic assessment policies change in China over the last decade. The data were gathered by means of an online questionnaire survey, which obtained 263 Chinese ECRs’ responses. The main conclusions are: (a) journal-based indicators (e.g. journal reputation, Journal Impact Factor, Science Citation Index, etc.) are crucial when Chinese ECRs read and publish; (b) assessment policy plays a vital role when Chinese ECRs decide where to publish; (c) open access and open data have been widely recognized and warmly welcomed by Chinese ECRs, however, they will only publish in open access journals and open their research data if they get rewarded by the evaluation system; (d) most Chinese ECRs had good experience of peer review and they are in favor of double blind peer review; (e) Chinese ECRs are heavy users of social media, they are sophisticated in finding scholarly information online and communicating with peers and colleagues with social media tools © 2020.

AB  - Public libraries offer important services for newcomer populations, including forced migrants. They help facilitate the integration of forced migrants into the host country, increase their levels of trust within new communities, and build social capital. To date, however, the determinants of forced migrant engagement with public library services has been left unexplored. Here the impact of culture on conceptualizations of public library services, and the role of this on the adoption and use of public library services, is investigated using the Theory of information worlds. The analysis is based on data collected in semi-structured interviews with 30 UK service gatekeepers for forced migrants. Thematic analysis identified three conceptualizations of public library services as: (1) leisure services, that (2) offer information services, (3) as part of a larger system that includes other functions such as immigration and policing. These conceptualizations impact service use and, importantly, non-use. Further contributions of the work include the proposal that Maslow's (1943) Hierarchy of needs may serve as a moderating variable for the five societal elements of the Theory of information worlds, and practical recommendations for public library staff keen to increase forced migrant engagement with the services that they offer.

AB  - In recent years, leading website search engines have abandoned vital search features supporting complex information needs, evolving instead for the marketplace and for users seeking speedy answers to easy questions. The consequences are troubling, for researchers and for information science educators, with concerns ranging from the very relevance of search results and the unknowing of what is missing, to the novice searcher’s waning ability to frame potent queries and to learn ways to refine results. We report on a grounded theory study of search experiences of information professionals and graduate students (n = 20) that contributes a holistic understanding of web searching, using its findings both to frame what is lacking in the design evolution of search engines for complex information needs and to outline a way forward. One goal of the study was to evaluate an established model of web searching, called Net Lenses, a theoretical framework shown to be highly relevant during the study’s grounded theory secondary literature review. The original Net Lenses research used phenomenography to identify variation in the web search experiences of university students (n = 41), evidencing four categories according to the characteristics of searcher awareness, approach to learning, response to obstacles and search outcomes. This study validated the model and led to an expanded version, Net Lenses 2.0, with five categories of search experience, reflecting the complex information needs of more advanced searchers. This resultant Net Lenses 2.0 model is discussed with its implications for search engine design, for advanced searchers and also for learning-to-search modes, much needed by searchers seeking to develop their abilities. The study’s implications coalesce in a call to action for more inclusive search interface design, and an agenda is put forth for how information researchers, educators and literacy advocates can move forward in their intersecting domains. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This paper reports on the information practices and information literacy (IL) skills of South Korean elementary school students from the perspectives of working teachers. Key to this investigation was the notion of information practice, and how this is shaped by the practice architecture found in an educational setting. A sequential mixed design was undertaken to investigate these ideas which consisted of exploratory interviews with 4 elementary school teachers and was followed by a questionnaire which analysed the responses of 314 elementary school teachers. Findings indicate that in this setting, teachers, students and pre-set curricular content serve as the most frequently used information sources for students during their everyday classes. We pay specific attention to the ongoing centrality of the textbook, in its traditional paper format, to the ways in which teachers design learning activities, and suggest that this limits the diversity of informational approaches to which young South Korean learners are exposed. While these learners are engaged, they are limited in terms of informational genre since teachers and textbooks were found to be dominant information proxies. Activities in which students engage in active seeking or scanning are rarer. Contexts with such a configuration may be hindering the development of critical information literacy skills that are vital in dealing with the abundance of information faced by individuals today. © 2022, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

AB  - Purpose: Despite lifestyle information needs being an important part of our daily lives, little is known about the role of common sources. Whilst magazines and television are traditional providers of lifestyle content, including for fashion, makeup, fitness and cookery, they have been partly replaced by content-creating online influencers. Design/methodology/approach: To investigate this new resource, this article analyses comments on the videos of 223 UK female lifestyle influencers on YouTube for information about possible viewing patterns. Findings: Three quarters of comments are written during the week of the video being published, consistent with videos being consumed with an information browsing function, rather than treated as an information resource to be searched when needed. Commenting on the videos of multiple influencers occurred often, suggesting that many viewers are not loyal to a single influencer. Thus, influencers seem to primarily support active scanning rather than searching for specific information. Typical viewers of UK female lifestyle influencers can therefore expect to accumulate lifestyle ideas and knowledge for potential future use in addition to gaining timely suggestions for near future routine decision-making. Practical implications: Public-facing information professionals, health professionals and counsellors may consider recommending selected videos or influencers to help with lifestyle concerns. Originality/value: This is the first large scale study of content-creating influencers as a lifestyle information resource. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This research addresses lack of a holistic and rigorous understanding of designers' information behaviour, through outlining seven dimensions for investigation, analysis, and capture of designers' use and requirements of information within the design process. ‘Practicing designers’ and ‘people information’ are focussed upon. Four initial information dimensions are outlined through literature analysis and synthesis in Information sciences and Design. These are iteratively evaluated, refined, and detailed through four empirical studies i.e. interview and questionnaire administered to design companies (N = 9); observation of a design team in a real-world design project (N = 5); observation of three teams throughout a design competition (N = 22); and a survey of designers and design researchers (N = 89). A novel set of information dimensions is synthesized including ‘Purpose’, ‘Source’, ‘Format’, ‘Content’, ‘Attributes’, ‘Stage’ and ‘Intensity’. Furthermore, practicing designers' people information behaviour is detailed using these seven dimensions. Findings both enhance theoretical understanding of information behaviour in design, and provide new empirical data on designerly information behaviour. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group Printed in the UK.

AB  - Background: The ever-growing amount of health information available on the web is increasing the demand for tools providing personalized and actionable health information. Such tools include symptom checkers that provide users with a potential diagnosis after responding to a set of probes about their symptoms. Although the potential for their utility is great, little is known about such tools' actual use and effects. Objective: We aimed to understand who uses a web-based artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker and its purposes, how they evaluate the experience of the web-based interview and quality of the information, what they intend to do with the recommendation, and predictors of future use. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of web-based health information seekers following the completion of a symptom checker visit (N=2437). Measures of comprehensibility, confidence, usefulness, health-related anxiety, empowerment, and intention to use in the future were assessed. ANOVAs and the Wilcoxon rank sum test examined mean outcome differences in racial, ethnic, and sex groups. The relationship between perceptions of the symptom checker and intention to follow recommended actions was assessed using multilevel logistic regression. Results: Buoy users were well-educated (1384/1704, 81.22% college or higher), primarily White (1227/1693, 72.47%), and female (2069/2437, 84.89%). Most had insurance (1449/1630, 88.89%), a regular health care provider (1307/1709, 76.48%), and reported good health (1000/1703, 58.72%). Three types of symptoms-pain (855/2437, 35.08%), gynecological issues (293/2437, 12.02%), and masses or lumps (204/2437, 8.37%)-accounted for almost half (1352/2437, 55.48%) of site visits. Buoy's top three primary recommendations split across less-serious triage categories: primary care physician in 2 weeks (754/2141, 35.22%), self-treatment (452/2141, 21.11%), and primary care in 1 to 2 days (373/2141, 17.42%). Common diagnoses were musculoskeletal (303/2437, 12.43%), gynecological (304/2437, 12.47%) and skin conditions (297/2437, 12.19%), and infectious diseases (300/2437, 12.31%). Users generally reported high confidence in Buoy, found it useful and easy to understand, and said that Buoy made them feel less anxious and more empowered to seek medical help. Users for whom Buoy recommended "Waiting/Watching" or "Self-Treatment" had strongest intentions to comply, whereas those advised to seek primary care had weaker intentions. Compared with White users, Latino and Black users had significantly more confidence in Buoy (P<.05), and the former also found it significantly more useful (P<.05). Latino (odds ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.22-3.25) and Black (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.57-3.66) users also had stronger intentions to discuss recommendations with a provider than White users. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the potential utility of a web-based health information tool to empower people to seek care and reduce health-related anxiety. However, despite encouraging results suggesting the tool may fulfill unmet health information needs among women and Black and Latino adults, analyses of the user base illustrate persistent second-level digital divide effects. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - A review of a range of epistemic concepts that are commonly researched was conducted with reference to conventional epistemology and with reference to foundational approaches to justification. These were assessed in relation to previous research undertaken linking information behavior and experience with paradigm, metatheory, and discourse. This research assesses how the epistemic concept is treated, both within information science and within disciplines that have affinities to the topics or agents that have been the subject of inquiry within the field. An attempt is made to clarify the types of connections that are associated with the epistemic concept and to provide a clearer view of how research focused on information behavior might consider the questions underpinning assumptions relating to knowledge and knowing. The symbiotic connection between epistemics and information science is advanced as a suitably nuanced conception of socially organized knowledge from which to define the appropriate level at which knowledge claims can be usefully advanced. It is proposed that fostering a better understanding of epistemics as a research practice might also provide for the development of a range of insights and methods that reflect the dynamic context within which the study of information behavior and information experience is located. © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - This paper explores the everyday information practices of ethnic minorities with small populations (EMSP) to identify the conditions that affect their information practices within the context of Chinese culture. A qualitative study was conducted with China’s ethnic minorities, and data were collected through in-depth interviews and observations involving 45 participants. The data were statistically analyzed and processed using three levels of qualitative data coding analysis to identify the conditions that affect their everyday information practices. Findings show that the information needs of EMSP in China are relatively centralized, their sources of information acquisition are relatively fixed, and they do not cross ethnic group boundaries to share information with the outside world. In addition, traditions, customs, lifestyle, and ethnic identity are the conditions that influenced their everyday information practices. These results further the understanding of ethnic characteristics and traditional culture as conditions that can influence everyday information practices. © 2021

AB  - In recent progress in information behavior research, people have been at the center of investigations. Thomas Wilson's popular general model of information behavior has evolved from the growing realization that information behavior occurs across many contexts. The current proposal suggests adding the influence of impacts to Wilson's general model of information processing and use. By accounting for past experiences with information sources, information scientists are better able to tackle society's grand challenges. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

AB  - Information resilience has become a topic of interest to the information science community in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the vulnerability of information and other networks and the impact on information providers and the information seekers who rely on them. In an exploratory study, we interviewed support workers who act as information intermediaries as part of their work roles about their experiences of providing information to vulnerable and marginalised people during the UK COVID-19 lockdown. We present findings organised in three themes: shifting client information needs and support provisions, adjusting information sharing and communication practices and workarounds for physical information work. Throughout the themes, information resilience is evident as information intermediaries adapt their work practices to ensure they can continue to serve their clients. In this first stage of research our findings provide insight into the changes to information intermediaries' information behaviour and information work during a crisis, as well as the impact of these changes on the services they provide.

AB  - Individuals' cultural backgrounds influence their use of societal resources, including libraries. A literature search and review was completed on the treatment of culture in library and information science (LIS) in the body of work on information behaviour and use. While much of the literature reviewed cites culture as an important influence, few researchers define culture as a concept, nor do they explore in detail the factors that it comprises. In this body of work culture is primarily used in two ways: (a) to differentiate groups of library users; and (b) to draw attention to questions of integration. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

AB  - A group trip entails collaborative information behaviour (CIB) of multiple actors seeking, sharing, and using travel-related information. However, there is a lack of investigation on how people choose to assume or be appointed different CIB roles during such leisure projects. Thus, limited information support is provided to travellers involved in group trips. This article investigates role adoption to show how group travellers involved in CIB through different actions. A naturalistic inquiry on CIB was conducted with 20 travel groups from mainland China to Australia. Of these, 36 real tourists participated in the study through initial demographic questionnaires, pre- and post-trip interviews, and self-reported diaries during the travel. Data were analysed using iterative coding guided by the constructivist grounded theory. Results suggested the complexity of CIB among group travellers. Besides searching together as equal peers, most group travellers voluntarily assume different CIB roles which are often implicit. Six distinct CIB roles were identified, including team player, all-rounder, influencer, authoritarian, supporter, and follower. Furthermore, the distribution of such roles in a travel group was examined and classified into five patterns. The findings also contribute to information seeking research in tourism discipline. Practical implications are provided regarding system support for collaborative work and tourism information provision. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The popular outdoor pursuit of backpacking is profoundly changing as the community embraces contemporary information technologies. However, there is little empirical evidence on the adoption and use of consumer electronics by backpackers, nor the implications this has for their habits, practices, and interactions. We investigate long-distance backpackers' articulations with mobile information technology during the TGO Challenge, a coast-to-coast crossing of the Scottish Highlands. By employing mixed methods, we explore how and why backpackers use such technology when planning and undertaking their journeys via a survey (n = 116), pre- and post-challenge interviews with selected TGO participants, and daily in-field video-logs. Our results suggest many advantages to using technology in this context, including fluidity of communications and access, while noting that reliance on technology is leading to issues such as increased need for battery power management, and deskilling. The findings highlight implications for the juxtaposition between outdoor recreation, information behavior, and human computer interaction (HCI) and suggest future work in this area. © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - This study investigates how memory affects everyday information behavior. Previous literature generally examined memory as a broad category, missing to consider how the variance in memory influences information behavior. To bridge this gap, we interviewed and observed 10 arts and crafts hobbyists when they navigated a creative shopping space designed to spark serendipity. Findings demonstrate the distinction between memory, including positive, negative, and practical, along with their potential impacts on everyday information behavior. This work provides a novel analysis of memory, shedding new light on the subtlety of memory in information behavior research. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine to what extent a person’s psychophysiological well-being is affected by misinformation and whether their level of information discernment has any positive or negative effect on the outcome. Design/methodology/approach: Participants (n = 48) were randomly and blindly allocated to one of two groups: control group participants were told a person they were working with was a student; experimental group participants were additionally led to believe that this other participant had extreme religious views. This was both stigmatising and misinforming, as this other person was an actor. Participants completed a pre-screening booklet and a series of tasks. Participants’ cardiovascular responses were measured during the procedure. Findings: Participants with high levels of information discernment, i.e. those who are curious, use multiple sources to verify information, are sceptical about search engine information, are cognisant of the importance of authority and are aware that knowledge changes and is contradictory at times exhibited an adaptive stress response, i.e. healthy psychophysiological outcomes and responded with positive emotions before and after a stressful task. Social implications: The findings indicate the potential harmful effects of misinformation and discuss how information literacy or Metaliteracy interventions may address this issue. Originality/value: The first study to combine the hitherto unrelated theoretical areas of information discernment (a sub-set of information literacy), affective states (positive affect negative affect survey) and stress (challenge and threat cardiovascular measures). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The methodology includes a study of various information behaviour models selected randomly, a systematic review of the subject literature, types of models and the exploration of relevant qualitative research methods. The paper shows how the different factors influence the information needs of user groups. Different viewers’ opinions on various models have been analyzed and at the same time the testing groups of each model have also been identified. The study concludes that each model represents a different but also an overlapping or similar approach to information-seeking behaviour research. The study on conceptual analysis of 24 different types of model, models name, year and types related information behaviour, studies examining the above issue, with a focus on the scrutiny of six major models for information behavior. © 2021.

AB  - This study is an exploratory research which examined textile traders’ information behaviour on loan procurement. The study adopted the qualitative approach. Purposive and snowballing techniques were used in selecting 35 traders who were major players in the market and data were collected through face-to-face interviews. Data collected were analysed thematically. Findings showed that information on loans with low interest rates was the most frequent information need and face-to-face communication with information sources was most preferred when seeking information on loan procurement. The most patronised loan source were the cooperative societies, while microfinance banks were the least. Challenges to loan procurement included disinformation from loan sources and risk of falling victims to fraudulent transactions. Limited patronage of microfinance institutions indicates the need for the Federal Government of Nigeria to review the activities of these institutions and ensure that they are meeting their objectives especially since they were specifically set up to cater for the financial needs of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). © 2021, Archlib and Information Services Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This article describes the third part of a three-stage study investigating the information behaviour of fans and fan communities, the first stage of which is described in the study by Price and Robinson (2017). Design/methodology/approach: Using tag analysis as a method, a comparative case study was undertaken to explore three aspects of fan information behaviour: information gatekeeping; classifying and tagging and entrepreneurship and economic activity. The case studies took place on three sites used by fans–Tumblr, Archive of Our Own (AO3) and Etsy. Supplementary semi-structured interviews with site users were used to augment the findings with qualitative data. Findings: These showed that fans used tags in a variety of ways quite apart from classification purposes. These included tags being used on Tumblr as meta-commentary and a means of dialogue between users, as well as expressors of emotion and affect towards posts. On AO3 in particular, fans had developed a practice called “tag wrangling” to mitigate the inherent “messiness” of tagging. Evidence was also found of a “hybrid market economy” on Etsy fan stores. From the study findings, a taxonomy of fan-related tags was developed. Research limitations/implications: Findings are limited to the tagging practices on only three sites used by fans during Spring 2016, and further research on other similar sites are recommended. Longitudinal studies of these sites would be beneficial in understanding how or whether tagging practices change over time. Testing of the fan-tag taxonomy developed in this paper is also recommended. Originality/value: This research develops a method for using tag analysis to describe information behaviour. It also develops a fan-tag taxonomy, which may be used in future research on the tagging practices of fans, which heretofore have been a little-studied section of serious leisure information users. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Misinformation is a significant phenomenon in today's world: the purpose of this paper is to explore the motivations behind the creation and use of misinformation. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review was undertaken, covering the English and Russian language sources. Content analysis was used to identify the different kinds of motivation relating to the stages of creating and communicating misinformation. The authors applied Schutz's analysis of motivational types. Findings: The main types of motivation for creating and facilitating misinformation were identified as “in-order-to motivations”, i.e. seeking to bring about some desired state, whereas the motivations for using and, to a significant extent, sharing misinformation were “because” motivations, i.e. rooted in the individual's personal history. Originality/value: The general model of the motivations underlying misinformation is original as is the application of Schutz's typification of motivations to the different stages in the creation, dissemination and use of misinformation. © 2020, Thomas D.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates perceptions of the use of online tracking, a passive data collection method relying on the automated recording of participant actions on desktop and mobile devices, for studying information behavior. It scrutinizes folk theories of tracking, the concerns tracking raises among the potential participants and design mechanisms that can be used to alleviate these concerns. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses focus groups composed of university students (n = 13) to conduct an in-depth investigation of tracking perceptions in the context of information behavior research. Each focus group addresses three thematic blocks: (1) views on online tracking as a research technique, (2) concerns that influence participants' willingness to be tracked and (3) design mechanisms via which tracking-related concerns can be alleviated. To facilitate the discussion, each focus group combines open questions with card-sorting tasks. The results are analyzed using a combination of deductive content analysis and constant comparison analysis, with the main coding categories corresponding to the thematic blocks listed above. Findings: The study finds that perceptions of tracking are influenced by recent data-related scandals (e.g. Cambridge Analytica), which have amplified negative attitudes toward tracking, which is viewed as a surveillance tool used by corporations and governments. This study also confirms the contextual nature of tracking-related concerns, which vary depending on the activities and content that are tracked. In terms of mechanisms used to address these concerns, this study highlights the importance of transparency-based mechanisms, particularly explanations dealing with the aims and methods of data collection, followed by privacy- and control-based mechanisms. Originality/value: The study conducts a detailed examination of tracking perceptions and discusses how this research method can be used to increase engagement and empower participants involved in information behavior research. © 2021, Mykola Makhortykh, Aleksandra Urman, Teresa Gil-Lopez and Roberto Ulloa.

AB  - This study aims to examine the information behavior and acquisition of government information by Israeli citizens on social media. A mixed-methods research approach was used, with the study conducted in two main stages: an online survey, via a questionnaire distributed among Israeli citizens, and in-depth interviews. Both stages focus on citizens’ patterns of use, experience, and acquisition of government information through various digital means. The findings indicate that users do not prefer social networks to actively retrieve government information. They also avoid making direct inquiries to government bodies on these platforms, either out of fear of an invasion of privacy, or due to a lack of trust in the government. However, social media channels provide fertile ground for accidental and unintentional exposure to government announcements and updates. The findings also show that users with higher digital literacy and high internal political efficacy are more likely to rely on digital media as a tool for data acquisition and exposure to new public information. Our work offers a new way to classify different types of exposure to government information, distinguishing between intentional and accidental exposure through various platforms. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic introduced significant information challenges for older adults worldwide. Given the widespread disparities in information infrastructure and access between developing and developed countries, the challenges presented during this period may be even more grave in the developing world. This interview study examines how older adults (age 65+) in two countries—the USA and India—experienced information needs, sources, and barriers. The results indicate distinct experiences among the two populations, with individuals in the USA expressing more diverse needs, while Indian respondents focused on the impact of COVID-19. The American respondents also indicated much greater use of Internet resources compared to the Indian respondents, who used television and print resources more frequently. Far more Indian respondents reported significant challenges finding information to satisfy their information needs. The findings of this study have important ramifications for the design of intervention, education, and support for the information-related needs of older adults worldwide. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study evaluates different antecedents affecting information sharing via multiple social media platforms on a large scale. In doing so, this research compares the effects of information sharing behavior factors via Facebook and WeChat adoption. The respondents were international students studying in two Chinese universities and are the frequent users of both social media platforms. At first, quantity data has been collected through an online survey. Second, in-depth interviews were conducted to get qualitative data. To test our model and hypotheses multigroup analysis and content analysis were used. All exogenous variables such as perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), Technological innovation (INNO) and information sharing attitude (ATT) have a positive effect on information sharing behavior (BEH). In addition, the results indicated no difference effects of PU and ATT via multiple social media platforms (WeChat and Facebook). However the effect of PEOU on information sharing attitude varied via social media platforms (WeChat and Facebook). The author found positive and stronger relationship between PEOU and ATT which is significant for Facebook only. On the other hand, the positive relationship between INNO and ATT is significant and stronger for WeChat only. We found the least research about information sharing behavior via multiple social media platforms. Besides, this study describes the patterns of information sharing on Facebook and WeChat, simultaneously. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - While there is a growing body of research on information behavior during nonroutine events such as natural disasters, the research has largely neglected older persons as a specific group despite their identification as a demographic that suffers disproportionately during disasters. To address this gap, this article reports on the study of the information behavior and related activities of older persons during natural disasters. Based on a qualitative study, we draw on the theory of information worlds to study the key activities of preparing, responding, and recovering from disasters. The article contributes to the information behavior literature by developing a more informed understanding of both the interrelationship between the information worlds and activities of older persons, and how older persons seek and share information during disasters. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - Purpose: In the domain of information science, affordance is a relatively new concept that deserves further exploration. It may serve as a bridge to narrow the research-practice gap that has persisted in information studies. Building upon previous research, we call for a broader concept of affordance that would help researchers understand information practices from an ecological perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The study focuses on conceptualizing affordances for information practices in order to theorize engagement among people, technology, and sociocultural environments. We develop a hierarchical model and a component model to illustrate how key tenets of affordances can be linked with the decomposition of activities and its mechanism. Following this, we describe an illustrative case of a popular Chinese cloud-based music platform to demonstrate the utility of our conceptual frameworks in guiding studies of information practices. Findings: The study proposes to shift the focus of technology affordances, which highlights the features and functions of particular technologies, to the affordances for practices that are enacted through technology and social construction within a sociocultural environment. The illustrative case of the cloud-based music platform shows that the proposed models can provide a structured view of operations, actions and motives for music information practices. The processes of internalization and externalization offer insight into the decomposition of information practice as a chain of activity-action-operation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on theorizing engagement among people, technology and sociocultural environments through the theoretical lens of affordances and sheds new light on the challenges of information practice. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: A significant body of literature suggests that shipping companies operate in an extremely volatile and risky environment, relying on the effective use of information to remain competitive. However, decision-making in this market is demanding because of the high uncertainty, market competition and significant capital investments. Moreover, the rapid spread of COVID-19 renders information uncertainty a daunting challenge for companies engaged in global trade. Hence, this study aims to explore the information behavior of managers in a time of crisis seems compelling. Design/methodology/approach: This study provides novel insights into the information behavior of senior managers by adopting a qualitative approach. Forty-nine semi-structured face-to-face interviews with individuals from Hellenic shipping companies were conducted. Moreover, this study explores the extant theory qualitatively, using the grounded theory methodology and shows that an unprecedented event (pandemic crisis) can redefine the information behavior of managers. Findings: This study highlights the importance of information in decision-making. Moreover, the results show that, during a pandemic, managers resort to alternative information sources, adopt collaborative information behaviors and take advantage of digital technology. Originality/value: There is limited research in exploring the information behavior of managers in times of pandemics. This research underscores the fact that during a crisis, managers seek information from digital information resources and decision-making assumes a more decentralized form. This study concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2021, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.

AB  - Information studies characterize the beginning of information as creation, a point of origin. Adapting a continuum approach, this study focuses on the create dimension of the Information and Records Continuum models developed by Frank Upward and his colleagues (Upward, 2000). The context of this study is humanitarian aid and how the interactions of actors within the not-for-profit sector create information used to develop campaigns, design strategies for fundraising, and support beneficiaries, the recipients of aid. Semi-structured interviews and participatory observation were conducted in an international non-governmental organization working with vulnerable communities in Bangladesh. Applying the two continuum models provides insights into the development of aid workers' complex information ecosystem. Using the continuum models in analyzing the data for information and records creation suggest the potential use for these models to provide a theoretical framework in further information behavior studies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: This article aims to help music librarians and other information professionals effectively understand and support communities of choral directors and other groups dependent on networking and serendipitous information encounters. In addition, through discussion and comparison of theories of information behavior, research articles and analysis of events and experiences, the article encourages thoughtful and practical applications of information behavior research. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper uses different theories of information behavior to outline three distinct modes of learning and knowing within communities of choral directors: individual searching, community expertise and serendipitous encounters. Findings: The choral directing community is one that benefits not only from information support systems that emphasize individual information seeking, but also collaborative networking and serendipitous encounters with other community members. Librarians and other information professionals can best help this group discover new repertoire, plan concert programs, improve rehearsals and support other relevant activities through understanding and helping to provide access to professional music networks and being creative in providing opportunities for serendipitous information discovery. Originality/value: Little information behavior research and discussion have focused specifically on the information practices of choral directors and how the format and schedule of a professional choral conference illuminate such practices and needs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Information researchers increasingly use participatory, arts-based methods to better understand the social contexts of individuals and populations. However, it remains rare to engage in qualitative analysis of the resulting visual artefacts. This article explores approaches to analysing visual media generated through a specific arts-based method, information world mapping (IWM), an interdisciplinary draw-and-talk technique that elicits data about individuals’ social information worlds. Here, we test four approaches to analysing visual media generated through IWM: directed qualitative content analysis (QCA), compositional interpretation, conceptual analysis and visual discourse analysis using situational analysis (SA). QCA was effective in creating an overview of participants’ information practices, yet raised concern regarding interpretive bias. Using an inductive taxonomy for compositional interpretation, we identified genre conventions for IWMs. Conceptual analysis resulted primarily in a reflection of the research procedures and epistemology. SA, while time-consuming, generated a large amount of rich data, including discourses and power relations that were not identified in previous analysis of textual data. In a reversal of our previous stance that cautioned against IWM analysis, we encourage other researchers to consider integrated or secondary visual analysis of IWMs. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Conducting research that has social impact is more than simply disseminating research when it is completed. It is more than looking at the influence research has on a research field or discipline. Conducting research that has social impact is a process of engaging communities in the research process and ensuring that the communities that take part in the research experience benefits. Socially impactful research is messy and challenging. It takes commitment from researchers to consider social impact and integrate practices into the entire research process from planning to collecting data, to communicating and implementing findings with communities. While this research is taking place within the field of information behavior/information practices, many of the ways this research is carried out are hidden. In this panel, four information behavior/information practice researchers will discuss research projects that have social impact and “pull back the curtain” on their approach to this research, what this means practically for carrying out this research, as well as how research findings are communicated and applied. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

AB  - Virtue epistemology offers a yet-untapped path for ethical development in information science. This paper presents two empirical studies on intellectual humility (IH), a cornerstone intellectual virtue. Centrally, IH is a matter of being open to the possibility that one may be misinformed or uninformed; it involves accurately valuing one's beliefs according to the evidence. The studies presented in this paper explore the relationship between IH and people's information seeking and use. First, a correlational questionnaire study was conducted with 201 participants considering a recent, real-life task; second, a concurrent thinkaloud study was conducted with 8 participants completing 3 online search tasks. These studies give further color to prior assertions that people with higher IH engage in more information seeking. The results show, for instance, that those with higher IH may actually favor more easily accessible information sources and that some dimensions of IH, such as modesty and engagement, may be most important to information seeking. These findings offer a nuanced understanding of the relationship between IH and information behavior and practices. They suggest avenues for further research, and they may be applied in educational contexts and sociotechnical design. © 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology.

AB  - Taylor (1968) dramatically stated that information seekers/searchers do not use their real Q1-level of information need when formulating their query to the system. Instead, they use a compromised Q4-level form of their need. The article directly confronts what Taylor's (1968) Q1-level information need is–the “actual” or “real” information need of the searcher. The article conceptually and operationally defines what Taylor's Q1-level of information need is using Belkin's (1980) ASK concept as a basis for designing a system intervention that shifts the searcher from representing the Q4-level compromised form of the need in her query to representing instead her Q1-level real information need. The article describes the Q1 Actualizing Intervention Model, which can be built into a system capable of actualizing the uncertainty distribution of the searcher's belief ASK so that information search is directed by the searcher's real Q1-level information need. The objective of the Q1 Actualizing Intervention Model is to enable in our Knowledge Age the introduction of intervention IR systems that are organic and human-centric, designed to initiate organic knowledge production processes in the searcher. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Existing models of the information behaviour of various liberal professionals, especially lawyers, lack currentness. They do not adequately represent the full scope of how these professionals de facto attain information in their occupation. Without clarity about the contemporary information-gathering practice of liberal professionals in a workplace setting, scholars, technology entrepreneurs and policy makers might be relying on partial or outdated grounds, and the ability of the information specialists to provide an effective service for their patrons might also be hindered. With a focus on legal professionals, as they have experienced noteworthy changes in their occupation, purposive sampling was applied, and 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with practising lawyers in Israel. Participants were nationwide and ranged over 30 different areas of legal practice, with a fair diversity of other professionals and personal traits achieved. The content analysis revealed four distinctive forms in which lawyers in Israel gather information within the contemporary legal practice: (a) self-executed information-seeking, (b) mediated acquisition of information, (c) information discovery and (d) combined information-gathering – which in all compile 10 different habitual strategies of gathering information in their professional work. Finally, the study suggests a revised, integrative and inclusive model that provides a more accurate and profound understanding of legal professionals’ information-gathering practice. This comprehensive and current framework may serve as an insightful guide for understanding other information-rich liberal professions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study explored the determinants of postgraduates’ use of electronic information resources in federal universities in southern Nigeria. The purpose was to identify the factors that influence user behavior and ascertain how factor like self-efficacy could increase the use of electronic information resources. Descriptive survey method was adopted for the study. The sample size of 591 post graduates was selected through purposive sampling technique. The study used a researchers’ designed questionnaire for the collection of data which was analyzed using frequency counts, mean, and standard deviation. The findings of the study revealed that psychological factors such as trust on the information source and perceived usefulness, and self-efficacy and social factors like referral from course-mates and lecturers as the factors that influenced the use of electronic information resources. High self-efficacy level increased the use of electronic information resources among the respondents. Based on the findings, the study recommends that universities should improve their subscription to various electronic information resources through their libraries and such should be from renowned publishers of high impact to increase their usage. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Controlling the coronavirus pandemic is triggering a cross-border strategy by which national governments attempt to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. A response based on sharing facts about millions of private movements and a call to study information behavior during the global health crisis has been advised worldwide. The present study aims to identify the technologies to control the COVID-19 and future pandemics with massive data collection from users’ mobile devices. This research undertakes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the studies about the currently available methods, strategies, and actions to collect and analyze data from users’ mobile devices. In a total of 76 relevant studies, 13 technologies that are classified based on the following aspect of data and data management have been identified: (1) security; (2) destruction; (3) voluntary access; (4) time span; and (5) storage. In addition, in order to understand how these technologies can affect user privacy, 25 data points that these technologies could have access to if installed through mobile applications have been detected. The paper concludes with a discussion of important theoretical and practical implications of preserving user privacy and curbing COVID-19 infections in the global public health emergency situation. © 2021

AB  - This study examined the effects of relationship management by community health organizations on the situational perceptions, and, in turn, on information behaviors about health issues among community members. Survey data with 222 Asian Americans indicated that trust and control mutuality played different but complementary roles on problem recognition, involvement recognition, and constraint recognition, which then differently impacted four information behaviors ranging from information attending, information forwarding, information sharing, and information seeking. This study proposed and tested a public-oriented model and contributed to two lines of research: examining public-centered consequences of relationship management and exploring antecedents to the formation of publics. It has practical implications on fostering relationships and empowering community members. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Information transmission of innovation and peer effect among firms have significant impacts on innovation adoption decisions of firms, but those effects usually depend on the different types of inter-firm networks. Therefore, the diffusion of innovation (DOI) can be regarded as a process occurring in complex systems composed of different types of interactions, which can be categorized into links belonging to different layers of multiplex networks. This study aims to shed light on the complexity of innovation diffusion from the perspective of an information-behavior framework based on multiplex networks. The process of technology innovation adoption is formulated into two stages including information perception and decision making, and a novel innovation diffusion model based on duplex inter-firm networks, in which one layer has influence on information transmission and the other carrys the peer effect, is further proposed in this study. The simulation experiments indicate that the random-scale-free duplex networks are favourable to the diffusion speed while scale-free-scale-free duplex networks are conducive to the diffusion range. Moreover, within the scale-free-scale-free duplex networks, the diffusion speed will increase with the increasing of the power law index in the information network and decrease with the increasing of the power law index of the behavior network. The study contributes to the literature by establishing duplex network model that distinguishes links between information and behavior networks, and offers insights concerning optimization of network configuration in the promotion of DOI. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - To better account for information behavior in everyday life, the field must more fully explore information phenomena in the lifeworld, that is, information experience. This article shows that one way to do this is through the concept of understanding. Visual art is identified as an illuminating domain for an initial foray into such research. This article presents findings from a phenomenology-of-practice study of the information behavior of visual artists. Seven local artists documented their experiences creating self-portraits, and semistructured follow-up interviews were conducted. The findings show how these participants built understanding with information in their work of creating individual self-portraits. These understandings fall into two categories: of the self and of the artistic process. Many forms of information, traditional and novel, contribute to these understandings; examples of the latter include memories, the lived environment, profound experiences, and online browsing. These findings extend the literature on artists' information behavior, connect everyday information behavior to information experience, and illustrate a method for studying understanding empirically in information science. The article closes by discussing the meaning of these findings for the future of information science, suggesting that the kinds of information employed by artists might be recognized and appreciated more widely throughout society. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - The digital learning environment comprises various resources-didactically transformed and untransformed information, and mediated communication. Students’ information behaviour combines both actions characteristic of the traditional educational process and specific for the digital environment, based on digital tools and user interactions. Students’ information behaviour in the digital environment is considered as an indicator of their engagement in various educational activities that contribute to the personalisation of learning. The results of a survey on students’ preferences of information resources in the digital environment show that learners use a variety of information sources, but they mainly apply the methods of work in the “traditional” learning paradigm. They insufficiently use the digital environment potential of collaboration, knowledge exchange, and knowledge extraction from authentic sources. Obtained data indicates problems in students’ information culture and shortcomings in the methodological support of students’ autonomous work. Based on the results, recommendations on creating conditions for developing students’ prospective strategies of interaction with digital resources are proposed. These recommendations include a gradual increase of the authentic digital learning resources, an account of students’ information preferences, and a particular attention to the management issues in the digital learning environment. © 2021, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for people worldwide. To combat the virus, one of the most dramatic measures was the lockdown of 4 billion people in what is believed to be the largest quasi-quarantine in human history. As a response to the call to study information behavior during a global health crisis, we adopted a resource orchestration perspective to investigate six Chinese families who survived the lockdown. We explored how elderly, young and middle-aged individuals and children resourced information and how they adapted their information behavior to emerging online technologies. Two information resource orchestration practices (information resourcing activities and information behavior adaptation activities) and three mechanisms (online emergence and convergence in community resilience, the overcoming of information flow impediments, and the application of absorptive capacity) were identified in the study. © 2020

AB  - The global resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases is garnering attention amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination information debates in a Facebook group give participants access to second-hand knowledge conveying personal experiences. Through the lens of Speech Act Theory, this study analysed discourses on pro-and anti-vaccination perspectives along with views from vaccine hesitant groups. Analysis reveals significant criticism of behaviour around information. Findings indicate provision of substantiating information would play a crucial role in debate within divergent information contexts. Application of Speech Act Theory serves to inform participant communication more intimately and empowers their engagement in polarized discussion. © The Authors 2021.

AB  - The current study investigates cooking hobbyists' information behavior with emphasis on the sources used and information activities performed in different situations and in different stages. Drawing upon Stebbins' serious leisure theory, Hektor's framework of information activities, and Hartel's cooking stages, a web survey was designed including a serious leisure scale, sets of questions asking various information sources consulted, and frequencies of information activities performed when “trying new recipes” and “making dishes once made before” in the “exploring stage” and “planning stage.” Four hundred eighty-seven cooking hobbyists participated in the survey. Results show that while most cooking hobbyists tend to obtain cooking information through online sources, but some cooking hobbyists with higher scores on the serious leisure scale also value print resources. They also engage in various information activities more frequently. Comparing to “dishes made before,” cooking hobbyists are more likely to seek information when “trying new recipes.” Nevertheless, the home recipe was the only source consulted more frequently when making dishes people once made before. Cooking hobbyists tend to browse and exchange information more frequently in the exploring stage when gathering cooking ideas rather than in the planning stage. Suggestions for food ingredients online shopping websites, recipe-recommendation systems, culinary bookstores, and special libraries were also provided and discussed based on the findings. © 2021 Tien-I Tsai et al., published by Sciendo

AB  - First-time mothers have a unique and varied set of information needs, but at present, these needs are seldom adequately addressed by libraries in China. As a first step in making libraries more helpful to this group, this study reports the results of a series of interviews aimed at understanding new mothers' current information seeking behaviors. Thirty-seven first-time mothers (children from first year of birth to six years of age) took part in semi-structured in-depth interviews, answering questions about their information demand, information source selection (and factors influencing this selection), and obstacles encountered in the process of information search. It was found that first-time mothers' information-seeking behavior varies from stage to stage, e. g. between pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period. Internet search plays an important role because of its perceived convenience and accessibility, but trust is the key factor during the process of information selection, regardless of source. Overall, the mothers we interviewed seldom use the library. This paper puts forward some suggestions to remedy that situation: Libraries might consider opening a first-time-mothers reading room, increasing cooperative promotions with other institutions, providing diversified service projects, and organizing reading-promotion activities for first-time mothers at different stages. If implemented, these suggestions promise to help mothers navigate the transitions of pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Makerspaces are places for construction and creative expression using tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and sewing machines. In this study, we investigate how makers obtain information for their makerspace projects. The study focuses on four sources of information: people, documents, experimentation, and prior knowledge. On the basis of interviews with 13 makers, we analyze their use of these information sources in relation to different knowledge areas, creative-process stages, and relevance criteria. Our main findings are that (a) experimentation is a prime source of information, (b) ease and pleasure are the dominant relevance criteria, (c) process and situation receive little attention, and (d) information sources vary across process stages. Specifically, experimentation is the dominant information source during the construction stage. In addition, the relevance criteria show that the makers turn to people because it is pleasurable, to documents because it is easy, and to experimentation because it results in quality products. These results emphasize the importance of experimentation and suggest that it warrants closer attention in studies of the information behavior of makers and, more broadly, creative professionals. © 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology.

AB  - The article contributes both conceptually and methodologically to the study of online news consumption by introducing new approaches to measuring user information behaviour and proposing a typology of users based on their click behaviour. Using as a case study two online outlets of large national newspapers, it employs computational approaches to detect patterns in time- and content-based user interactions with news content based on clickstream data. The analysis of interactions detects several distinct timelines of news consumption and scrutinises how users switch between news topics during reading sessions. Using clustering analysis, the article then identifies several types of news readers (e.g. samplers, gourmets) and examines their news diets. The results point out the limited variation in topical composition of the news diets between different types of readers and the tendency of these diets to align with the news supply patterns (i.e. the average distribution of topics covered by the outlet). © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Purpose: Since Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004, migration from Poland to the UK has increased substantially. These migrants are generally young and highly educated, and are migrating for reasons of economic improvement and self-fulfilment. Many are women migrating independently, an emerging trend in migration in general. Information behaviour research around migration has tended to focus on populations such as refugees; less research has been done on the information behaviour of economic migrants. This paper, therefore, investigates the role of information in the migration experience of young Polish women in the UK. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes an interpretivist, constructionist perspective. An exploratory study was conducted, involving expert and pilot interviews and analysis of secondary data. In the main study, 21 participants were interviewed using a semi-structured technique. Data were analysed thematically. Findings: The paper provides insights into the information behaviour and experience of this migrant group. They were found to be confident and successful information users, partly because their migration was planned, their language skills were high and cultural differences from their host country were not substantial. Weak ties were an important source of information. The paper contextualises these findings against previous research on migration in information science, and presents a model of the underlying factors shaping the relationship between migration and information behaviour. Originality/value: The paper examines the migration experience of a relatively understudied group, drawing attention to a broader range of experience and demonstrating that a wider conceptualisation of migration is required in information behaviour. It presents a model of key factors shaping information behaviour around migration, which is relevant not only to the information field, but also to a wider range of areas. It also delivers practical recommendations for migrants and those working with them. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - As digital cultural collections become increasingly sophisticated in their scope and functionality, there is a need to build an in-depth understanding concerning the information behaviors of users in this new domain. Research has demonstrated that many digital museum visitors are engaged in casual leisure during exploration of a collection, suggesting that they do not have an inherent information goal but rather seek new experiences or learning opportunities based on personal curiosity and moments of discovery. Consequently, understanding how to translate casual leisure contexts into meaningful interaction design may play a critical role in designing engaging digital collections. Our study reports on the user experience of a largely unexplored user interface design framework called rich-prospect, which was originally developed to enhance browsing and discovery for complex visual collections. We performed a mixed-method, within-subjects study (N=30) that simulated a casual leisure approach to information browsing and retrieval across three different rich-prospect interfaces for digital cultural heritage. Our results show that rich-prospect scores well in the hedonic facets of its user experience, whereas pragmatic aspects have room for improvement. Additionally, through our qualitative analysis of participant feedback, we derived salient themes relating to the exploratory browsing experience. We conclude with a series of design implications to better connect interactive elements with casual leisure contexts for digital cultural collections.  © 2021 Owner/Author.

AB  - Purpose: In order to understand the totality, diversity and richness of human information behavior, increasing research attention has been paid to examining serendipity in the context of information acquisition. However, several issues have arisen as this research subfield has tried to find its feet; we have used different, inconsistent terminology to define this phenomenon (e.g. information encountering, accidental information discovery, incidental information acquisition), the scope of the phenomenon has not been clearly defined and its nature was not fully understood or fleshed-out. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, information encountering (IE) was proposed as the preferred term for serendipity in the context of information acquisition. Findings: A reconceptualized definition and scope of IE was presented, a temporal model of IE and a refined model of IE that integrates the IE process with contextual factors and extends previous models of IE to include additional information acquisition activities pre- and postencounter. Originality/value: By providing a more precise definition, clearer scope and richer theoretical description of the nature of IE, there was hope to make the phenomenon of serendipity in the context of information acquisition more accessible, encouraging future research consistency and thereby promoting deeper, more unified theoretical development. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Emergent realities such as the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding “infodemic,” the resurgence of Black Lives Matter, climate catastrophe, and fake news, misinformation, disinformation, and so on challenge information researchers to reconsider the limitations and potential of the user-centered paradigm that has guided much library and information studies (LIS) research. In order to engage with these emergent realities, understanding who people are in terms of their social identities, social power, and as epistemic agents—that is, knowers, speakers, listeners, and informants—may provide insight into human information interactions. These are matters of epistemic injustice. Drawing heavily from Miranda Fricker's work Epistemic Injustice: Power & the Ethics of Knowing, I use the concept of epistemic injustice (testimonial, systematic, and hermeneutical injustice) to consider people as epistemic beings rather than “users” in order to potentially illuminate new understandings of the subfields of information behavior and information literacy. Focusing on people as knowers, speakers, listeners, and informants rather than “users” presents an opportunity for information researchers, practitioners, and LIS educators to work in service of the epistemic interests of people and in alignment with liberatory aims. © 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - This research investigated health and safety information behaviour of miners working at Makarwal Coal Mines, district Mianwali, Punjab, Pakistan. A survey method using a questionnaire was deployed for data collection from 136 coal workers. Descriptive statistics were applied for data analysis using SPSS. The results indicated that the miners' information needs were cantered mainly on protection equipment, mining diseases, healthcare services, geological hazards, accidents associated with mining and modern mining techniques. These miners relied overwhelmingly on interpersonal relationships with fellow miners and friends for safety information followed by television and radio. A good number of the survey participants also utilized internet and social media such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. as information source. There was little evidence of the use of audio/visual materials, seminar/workshops, associations, government agencies, and printed materials for information acquisition. Computer illiteracy, poor financial conditions, lack of time, language barriers, lack of awareness and knowledge about safety information and nonavailability of relevant materials were perceived as the major constraints in acquiring safety information. The results will not only be useful for planning a need-based information infrastructure for miners but also for policymakers, NGOs and human rights organizations working for rural development and uplifting occupational health. This research contributed in the existing research on miners' information behaviour as only a few studies appeared. © 2021 De Gruyter Saur. All rights reserved.

AB  - Children and youth information behavior (CYIB) research has grown substantially in the past two decades. However, this research lacks systematic analysis of the scholarly journal literature, especially with respect to theoretical applications. This study content-analyzed articles published in fourteen key scholarly journals covering 1999 to 2019. The findings revealed that of the 893 articles retrieved from five online databases, 22.6% were relevant to theory use. Of these, 116 articles (60%) were theoretically grounded in theories or models. There was considerable growth in the use of theories as frameworks for the 2010–2019 period, as compared to the 1999–2009 period. Five key journals contributed the highest number of articles with theories or models applied as frameworks. Authors used more models than theories to ground their work. There was a frequent mention of theories or models in various sections of the articles, especially the introduction and review of the literature. The findings make a unique contribution to our understanding of the nature of theory use in CYIB research, its applications, and evolution over time, as well as strengths, weaknesses, and trends. This study has implications for LIS education, research, and practice. It also has theoretical and methodological implications.

AB  - Background: Technical communicators use special language information to describe technology products. Researching such information is part and parcel of their job and thus occupies a relevant share of their working time. Literature review: Numerous studies examine information needs and search techniques of various professionals, such as engineers or translators. However, very little is known about technical communicators' use of and requirements for information sources containing special language information. This article contributes to filling this research gap by discussing results of an empirical study. Research questions: 1. What types of nonhuman information sources do technical communicators use when researching special language information? 2. What properties do technical communicators expect from special language reference tools? Research methodology: We conducted a written online survey among technical communicators. In this article, we analyze and interpret survey data related to the two research questions. Results: Respondents use 14 major types of information sources for researching special language information. Half can be categorized as reference tools, while the other half are document-like. Respondents would like to have special language reference tools that are available electronically, can be adapted to their personal needs, and offer up-to-date information with good usability. Conclusions: Half of the information source types are document-like and can be used as text corpora. Thus, text corpus-management methods and tools should be promoted in technical communication practice and teaching. Technical communicators' requirements and wishes described in this article lay the groundwork for developing tailor-made special language reference tools.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to holistically explore the information needs of socioeconomically disadvantaged young first-time mothers and associated issues of complexity. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used survey and semi-structured field interviews with 39 young mothers (aged 15–23) from UK areas of multiple deprivations. Findings: Participants reported multiple and complex needs spanning interrelated topics of parenting, poverty and personal development. In the majority of instances, participants were either unsure of their ability to meet their needs or needed help with needs, and several described situations of considerable anxiety and stress. Multiplicity is identified and conceptualised as an important factor contributing to complexity, including three component elements: simultaneous occurrence of needs (concurrency), relationships between needs (interconnectivity) and evolving needs (fluidity). In various combinations, these elements influenced a mother's actions and/or ability to selectively attend to needs, with multiple needs often competing for attention, and compounding issues of cognitive load and affect. Research limitations/implications: This study draws attention to multiplicity of needs as an understudied topic within human information behaviour and calls for further research into how people recognise and attend to complex needs and influencing factors. Practical implications: This study raises important questions regarding how we approach complexity of information needs in our design and delivery of information systems and services. Originality/value: Evidences disadvantaged young mothers to have more extensive and complex information needs than previously understood, and identifies and conceptualised multiplicity as an important factor contributing to the complexity of information needs during major life transitions such as motherhood. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Substance use in universities in Nigeria continue to thrive despite the government and non-government effort to create awareness on the risks involved in the use of substance. This could be attributed to the inability to identify relevant information, inability to use to information appropriately to control the use of substances and the inability to determine the risks and health implication of substance use on academic performance. Empirical work exists to support health risks of substance use among undergraduates but it is not apparent that a study in Ogun State, Nigeria has addressed the influence of information behaviour and substance use. This study examined the influence of information behaviour on substance use among undergraduates in Ogun State, Nigeria. The study population comprised 82,809 undergraduates with a sample size of 1,513 using a two-stage sampling technique to determine the respondents. Findings showed that information behaviour significantly influenced substance use (R2= .022, β= .149, t (1,414)= 6.420, p<0.05). Alcohol had the highest lifetime use of 39.6% while cocaine use was the lowest at 2.9%. The frequency of substance use among undergraduates was low with majority (98.2%) showing never use of substance in their lifetime. The findings revealed averagely high information behaviour (Mean= 2.55). Information sources had outstanding contribution in information behaviour (Mean = 2.79). The study concluded that information behaviour influenced substance use of undergraduates in Ogun State, Nigeria. The study recommended provision of affordable rehabilitation facilities in all university campus by Government, Philanthropist, and religious body. © 2021

AB  - Purpose: The study aims to explore and discuss the extent of influence of informal communication on learning in a European social democracy political party through a dual lens approach combining information behaviour and organisational learning perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents results from an in depth qualitative study, whereby data were collected through semi-structured and episodic narrative interviews. Template analysis was used. Findings: Informal conversations were identified as intrinsic to the work of the political party. They did influence learning at individual and group levels, and there was a degree of diffusion within the organisation, although the latter was found to depend on opportunity, individual self-efficacy, level of involvement in the party and perceptions of who has influence. The dual lens approach facilitated greater levels of granularity of analysis at individual and group levels of learning. Research limitations/implications: The paper highlights the benefits of using a dual lens approach to add depth to the interpretation of the research findings. Due to the small number of participants further research is needed to verify and extend the results and support a greater degree of transferability. Originality/value: The information behaviour and organisational research theory that underpin the research have not been used together in this way before, and the context for the phenomenon being researched, a traditional political party struggling against the rise of populism in the 21st century, is both contemporary and understudied in each of the theory areas. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of deepening reform policies around smart healthcare, established a diversified technical basis and environmental protection, and deeply excavated the derivative value of healthcare information, aiming to provide high-quality healthcare services for patients. Information interaction in the context of smart healthcare is a kind of health information interaction completed by users with smart healthcare applications as the hub. It is an application form of social behavior and has an impact on value cocreation. Based on the theory of information interaction and value cocreation, this paper systematically reviews the research on information interaction and value cocreation in the smart healthcare context, analyzes the information interaction mode and information interaction mechanism in the smart healthcare context, constructs a theoretical model of the impact of information interaction on value cocreation, and empirically tests the relationship between information interaction and value cocreation in the smart healthcare context. The research of this paper aims to provide high-quality information interaction services for smart healthcare users, promote the dimensional management of information behavior in the context of smart healthcare, and promote the continuous improvement of the operation and management of smart healthcare. © 2021 Lan Zhang et al.

AB  - To be a smart and connected community is an aspiration and orientation. A goal of smart and connected communities is to make more effective and consistent use of data, information, and technology, and in many ways to operate at a critical junction between community members and an imagined future structured around a particular vision of the role of government, the role of participation, and often-conflicting visions of what these might become. This paper reports findings from 32 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the City of Austin Continuum of Care (CoC), a collaborative group of organizations working to end homelessness in the Austin/Travis County region, as well as critical analysis of their collaborative and siloed data resources. The key themes that emerged in this case study include the continual process of “becoming” a smart and connected community, focusing on the development and “accretion” of data and informational infrastructure, and its impact on the communities of practice related to providing services to people experiencing homelessness. The information behaviors of the stakeholders of the CoC demonstrates ongoing movement towards more collaborative resolutions of issues of data quality and interoperability, alongside a negotiation of the role of data-intensive structuring of collaborations and work.

AB  - Data reuse has recently become significant in academia and is providing new impetus for academic research. This prompts two questions: What precisely is the data reuse process? What is the connection between each participating element? To address these issues, 42 studies were reviewed to identify the stages and primary data reuse elements. A meta-synthesis was used to locate and analyze the studies, and inductive coding was used to organize the analytical process. We identified three stages of data reuse—initiation, exploration and collection, and repurposing—and explored how they interact and form iterative characteristics. The results illuminated the data reuse at each stage, including issues of data trust, data sources, scaffolds, and barriers. The results indicated that multisource data and human scaffolds promote reuse behavior effectively. Further, two data and information search patterns were extracted: reticular centripetal patterns and decentralized centripetal patterns. Three paths with elements cooperating through flexible functions and motivated by different action items were identified: data centers, human scaffolds, and publications. This study supports improvements for data infrastructure construction, data reuse, and data reuse research by providing a new perspective on the effect of information behavior and clarifying the stages and contextual relationships between various elements. © 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology.

AB  - This paper investigates the interaction between translators’ perceived translation problems and their online consultation behaviours, and how different consultation behaviours affect translation acceptability. Previous studies indicate that online consultation includes various types of complex information-searching behaviours which, to a great extent, depend on the personal preferences of the web users. In this study, 38 MA translation students translated two 100-word texts from English (L2) into Chinese (L1) using Translog II, with their translations and consultation processes being registered by a Tobii TX300 eye-tracker. The main findings are as follows: (1) an increase in perceived translation difficulty leads to an increase in both the time spent on online consultation and the complexity of the consultation, but does not lead to an increase in the cognitive load expended on consultation; (2) general translation problems, which involve more resource types and longer search times, require more consultation time than specific translation problems; (3) two sub-types of consultation behaviour, information-seeking and information relevance evaluation, are purpose-driven and (4) longer consultation time results in higher acceptability of individual translation solutions, while higher consultation complexity does not. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - User engagement is considered critical to technology interactions. The user engagement scale (UES) is a measurement tool for engagement based on self-reported measures. However, UES does not emphasize interactions with information and focus solely on perception. This visual presentation describes a novel conceptual and measurement framework to systematically describe and evaluate information engagement (IE). Following a comprehensive literature review, we conceptualize The process of information engagement (PIE) which includes three dimensions: (a) Participation - users' investment in the information interaction, including information retrieval and behavioral responses - measured through information exchange (b) Perception - users' relation to the information, the level of emotional involvement, interest and intent in the information (c) Perseverance – users' retention of the information, the quality of the integration and influence of the information. The findings provide foundation for future work to conceptualize and operationalize IE measurement across a range of situations. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

AB  - Current efforts to fight misinformation, disinformation, and fake news have been isolated and inadequate. Most models of information behavior deal with information, and not misinformation or disinformation per se. We seek to disambiguate the phenomenon by clarifying terms and highlighting efforts towards fighting fake news. Building upon Karlova and Fisher's, Information Research, 2013, 18, 1–17 model, we propose a new information behavior framework. It should guide practitioners and researchers in library and information science and beyond, and other stakeholders in understanding the phenomenon, and fighting against it. 83rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science & Technology October 25-29, 2020.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the clarification of core concepts in information experience research and to the consolidation of information experience as a distinctive research object. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a series of techniques from Wilson's toolkit of concept analysis. Findings: This study finds that there exist tensions between different uses of the term information experience, giving rise to two fundamentally different conceptions of this particular human experience which this study names, respectively, the posterior conception and the a priori conception. It also finds that it is linguistically more useful, practically more consonant with LIS's concerns and unitarily more consistent to define information experience following the a priori conception. It postulates that information experience can be defined as a person's subjective, pre-reflective living through of his/her life as an information user in the information sphere of the lifeworld. Research limitations/implications: If adopted by future research, the concept proposed in this study is likely to push information experience research toward a more prominent phenomenological turn on the one hand, and a return to conventional LIS concerns on the other. Practical implications: The clarified concept may help user experience librarians and system designers to see the relevance of information experience research for their work more clearly. Originality/value: By identifying, comparing and discussing different existing uses of information experience, and by suggesting a redefinition of the concept, this study has brought the core concepts of information experience research to a new level of clarity, and has verified information experience as a distinctive object for LIS research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how optimistic bias, consumption cognition, news attention, information credibility, and social trust affect the purchase intention of food consumption. Data used in this study came from a questionnaire survey conducted in college students in Taipei and Beijing. Respondents in the two cities returned 258 and 268 questionnaires, respectively. Samples were analyzed through structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the model. Results showed that Taiwanese college students did not have optimistic bias but Chinese students did. The models showed that both Taiwanese and Chinese students’ consumption cognition significantly influenced their purchase intention, and news attention significantly influenced only Chinese students’ purchase intention. Model comparison analysis suggested significant differences between the models for Taiwan and mainland China. The results revealed that optimistic bias can be reduced in different social contexts as that of the Taiwan model and the mainland Chinese model found in this study were indeed different. This study also confirmed that people had optimistic bias on food safety issues, based on which recommendations were made to increase public awareness of food safety as well as to improve government’s certification system. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Americans increasingly feel a sense of wonder at the universe; meditation and yoga are on the rise; and a field known as Contemplative Studies has emerged. These indicators, among others, suggest a groundswell of interest in contemplative practice and contemplative experience and raise intriguing questions for information and Information Studies. Against this backdrop, this paper asks: How might Information Studies contribute to these developments? What is the relationship between information and contemplation? What can be explored on this research frontier? Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper is based upon a synthesis of recent writings from the field of Contemplative Studies as well as conceptual analysis of selected papers and themes in Information Studies. It draws from discussion that occurred at a Session for Interaction and Engagement at the 2018 iConference, entitled “Contemplating Information in the Pleasurable and the Profound” (Latham et al., 2018). The authors' creative thinking and personal contemplative practices also infuse and fortify the work. Findings: Popular and academic contemplative movements are afoot, and Information Studies has an opportunity to participate or be left behind. The field of Contemplative Studies has established the foundational concepts that can serve as contextual material for information research into contemplation. Upon closer inspection, Information Studies has already broached the topic of contemplation at various points in its history, theory, institutional practices, and information behavior research. The conceptual points of departure for a research frontier are articulated. Originality/value: Beyond data, information, and knowledge are deeper and more profound aims, such as wisdom, which is related to contemplation. This paper supplies a rationale, scholarly community, conceptual resources, historical precedents, and guiding questions for bridging information and contemplation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore a different perspective about the role that information plays in the integration process of migrant workers by exploring the views and opinions of individuals and organizations that work with these communities on a daily basis. The study proposes a new perspective of Ager and Strang’s framework of integration by looking at its different elements through the perspective provided by Gibson and Martin’s (2019) concept of information marginalization and Dervin’s sense-making notion of resistance. Design/methodology/approach: Ten intermediaries working with migrants were interviewed using semi-structure interviews. They were analyzed using an integrative approach of deductive and inductive content analysis and rendered categories drawn from the theoretical frameworks and categories that emerged from the data. Findings: The content analysis of the data revealed that information marginalization is characterized by the lack of cultural knowledge and lack of language proficiency that impact the migrants abilities to fulfill their everyday needs, experience a safe and stable environment. Information marginalization results in migrants experiencing self-protective behaviors such as secrecy and an inability to trust information sources that are not contextualized by insiders. Findings show that information resistance can be overcome by making information available in relevant formats and distributed through trusted sources. Social implications: The study revises the notion of information marginalization by trying to understand the social and cultural gap that from both sides of the issues of integration. Originality/value: The study presents a different perspective of the role of information in the integration process of migrants by examining the views and opinions of intermediaries working with these populations. Also, the study reframes existing notions of information marginalization and resistance by addressing both sides of the cultural and social gap embodies marginalization. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The value of geologic data is well established and demonstrated by efforts such as EarthChem and EarthCube. Although these communities are active in the documentation and preservation of geologic data, more work is needed to understand how geologists use this data to address specific problems. In this preliminary analysis, we focus on the information behaviors of professional geologists as they engage with multiple data streams to make decisions. Using semi-structured interviews and grounded theory, our findings document how a single data point can drive changes to existing models. Responses also show that geologists view their experiences in data collection as critical and they use their knowledge and experience to iteratively re-assess the context and fitness of their data as they search for coherent interpretations that resolve data-model conflicts.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article is to examine the ways in which self-tracking data have meaning and value in and after the life of the creator, including how such data could become part of the larger historical record, curated in an institutional archive. In doing so, the article expands upon existing shared interests among researchers working in the areas of self-tracking, human–computer interaction and archival science. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 18 people who had self-tracked for six months or more were recruited for the study. Participants completed a survey which gathered demographic data and characteristics vis-à-vis their self-tracking behavior. In-person semi-structured interviews were then conducted to ascertain the beliefs of the participants regarding the long-term use and value of personal quantified-self data. Findings: The findings reveal the value that people place on self-tracking data, their thoughts on proper modes for accessing their archive once it moves from the private to the public space, and how to provide fidelity within the system such that their experiences are represented while also enabling meaning making on the part of subsequent users of the archive. Originality/value: Today’s quantified-self data are generally embedded in systems that create a pipeline from the individual source to that of the corporate warehouse, bent on absorbing and extracting insight from a totality of big data. This article posits that new opportunities for knowing and for design can be revealed when a public interest rationale is appended to rich personalized collections of small data. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - International students’ capacity to undertake a digital journey to embrace new digital resources has real life implications in terms of their ability to adjust to their new environment. This article explores links between international students’ use of online social networking sites and their social networks, including drawing on digital resources beyond only those from their home country. Given the increased focus on online learning and engagement with students in higher education, there is an even greater need to examine students’ digital journeys, in terms of their capacity to navigate both their academic worlds and everyday lives abroad. This article demonstrates that students continue to use a range of online sources from their home countries, even as they transition to their new lives in Australia. This has implications for the way institutions communicate with international students more broadly. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The objective of this paper is to document and analyze the organizational activities of faculty members using a personal information management (PIM) framework developed by Jacques (2016). Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were carried out with seven faculty members, focusing on their personal information organization practices as they relate to their academic activities. These interviews took the form of a guided tour of informants' digital workspaces. Findings: Analyses focused on PIM activities make it possible to identify the different strategies adopted by faculty members to organize their academic personal information. This qualitative approach highlights four activities involved in the organization of personal information: inclusion, exclusion, apprehension and implementation. It also reveals differences in the ability of faculty members to analyze their own practices. Finally, the relationship to time and memory of PIM practices is examined through the lens of the concepts of virtualization and actualization. Originality/value: This research provides a more nuanced understanding of PIM practices, specifically of organizational activities, by considering the meaning of these practices for individuals as part of their daily lives. It aims to foster literacy by facilitating the interactions of individuals with their personal information through educational activities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to explore the value of various notions of precarity for the study of information practices and for addressing inequities and marginalization from an information standpoint. Design/methodology/approach: Several interrelated conceptualizations of precarity and associated terms from outside of library and information science (LIS) are presented. LIS studies involving precarity and related topics, including various situations of insecurity, instability, migration and transition, are then discussed. In that context, new approaches to information precarity and new directions for information practices research are explored. Findings: Studies that draw from holistic characterizations of precarity, especially those engaging with theories from beyond the field, are quite limited in LIS research. Broader understandings of precarity in information contexts may contribute to greater engagement with political and economic considerations and to development of non-individualistic responses and services. Originality/value: The presentation of a framework for an initial model of information precarity and the expansion of connections between existing LIS research and concepts of precarity from other fields suggest a new lens for further addressing inequities, marginalization and precarious life in LIS research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the types and sources of information sought by older adults along with their motivations in the Midwestern United States. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were conducted with 30 older adults residing in rural communities around the Midwestern United States during late-summer (July/August) 2020, using a protocol based on Dervin's Sense-Making Methodology. The resulting data was analyzed using standard content analysis procedures, guided by the theoretical frameworks based on Dervin's Sense-Making and Williamson's Ecological Model of Information Behavior. Implications of COVID-19 for the normative behaviors described in these models are discussed. Findings: Findings show that older adults were concerned primarily with health and political information during this period, but that this information was not necessarily sought only to address an informational need, but also to satisfy the need to maintain social and emotional connections in coping with isolation and loneliness. Sources of information that allowed for social interaction with people were favored. Wider personal networks (community members) were strained by the social distancing measures and closures. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for considering the impact of social restrictions on information seeking behaviors of older adults in a time of crisis. Originality/value: This study is the first, known to the authors, that applied the two adopted theoretical frameworks to explore information seeking behaviors of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Excessive news consumption during global crises (e.g., through regularly monitoring fast-moving developments), can result in information fatigue and anxiety. Indeed, research has highlighted dangerous risks to mental wellbeing from “over-consumption” of Covid-related news. While prior research has examined how people find Covid-related information and sometimes avoid it to prevent overwhelm, no existing studies have investigated how people leverage information seeking, encountering and avoidance (often in concert) to self-regulate their Covid news consumption. We conducted a two-week diary study and follow-up interviews with 16 people. An inductive Thematic Analysis identified several strategies for self-regulating Covid news consumption: short-term avoidance of all Covid news, selective avoidance (e.g., of news on particular Covid topics), selective consumption of Covid news from particular sources, news perceived to be within one's control, or news likely to be of personal benefit and conscious consumption of Covid news by limiting time spent consuming it, relying on passively encountering (rather than actively seeking) it and consuming it less frequently by returning to pre-pandemic news-browsing routines. An understanding of Covid news self-regulation strategies can help digital platforms that provide crisis-related news better support people in regulating their information consumption more effectively which, in turn, can help safeguard their mental wellbeing.

AB  - Drawing on pragmatist ideas proposed by John Dewey, the study elaborates the picture of information experience by examining how researchers have characterized the ways in which people receive, acquire and interpret sensory and cognitive-affective information. To this end, a conceptual analysis was conducted by concentrating on 43 studies pertinent to the topic. The findings indicate that so far, the construct of information experience has remained quite vague. This is mainly due to that experience - the fundamental constituent of information experience – has not been sufficiently reflected in the context of informational phenomena. Information experience studies have mainly contributed to information behaviour research by describing how people receive and acquire sensory information, while the picture of experiencing cognitive-affective information has remained quite vague. There are also gaps in studies examining how sensory and cognitive-affective information are interpreted as an integral part of information experience. The study also identifies topics of further research dealing with the elaboration of the construct of information experience. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Although Washington state sanctuary policies of 2017 prohibit collaboration between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement in noncriminal cases, compliance with sanctuary policies has not been systematically studied. We explore information practices and collaboration between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement in Grant County, Washington, based on records from November 2017 to May 2019 obtained by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights through Public Records Act (PRA) requests. Qualitative analysis of over 8,000 pages reveals a baseline of passive and active information sharing and collaboration between local law enforcement and federal immigration agencies before Washington sanctuary laws went into effect in May 2019, a practice that needs to stop if agencies are to comply with the laws. We employ a systematic methodology to obtain (through PRA and other Access to Information requests) and analyze official records through qualitative content analysis, to monitor and hold local law enforcement accountable in their compliance with sanctuary laws. This method can be used to examine law enforcement information behaviors in other counties in Washington, and in other states that offer sanctuary protections, as a way to monitor compliance with sanctuary laws and strengthen the protection of immigrants' rights. © 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology.

AB  - Purpose: Studies on the information behaviour of immigrants including refugees across the globe show a significant dependency of immigrants on their informal networks for meeting various settlement and everyday life information needs. Although there are quite a few studies in LIS that globally report the dependency of immigrants on their personal networks, very little is known about their experiences with their informal personal networks in the contexts of their settlement in informational terms. This paper explores the information experiences of Bangladeshi immigrants in Canada consulting informal networks including broader Bangladeshi community people in pre- and post-arrival contexts. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a mixed-method approach including semi-structured interviews (n = 60) and surveys (n = 205) with Bangladeshi immigrants who arrived in Canada between the years of 1971 and 2017. Interview data were analysed thematically, and descriptive statistics are used to describe the survey data relevant to this study. Findings: Although the overall scope of the original study is much larger, this paper features findings on the information experience derived from an analysis of the interview data with some relevant references to the survey data when deemed appropriate. This paper provides insights into the information experiences of Bangladeshi immigrants within their personal networks, including friends, family and ethnic community people. The findings of this study show that participants sometimes received discouraging, unhelpful or wrong information from their personal networks. The multiple dimensions of the information experiences of the study participants show the many consequences for their settlement lives. For some participants, settlement was particularly impacted by the concept of “information sharing fear” that emerged from the interviews. Information sharing fear relates to concerns that sharing information about the challenges faced by newcomers could be considered by potential immigrants as a kind of active “discouragement”. Participants described being sensitive to charges of envy or jealousy when they shared information related to challenges newcomers face, as friends and family see them as trying to prevent competition for social status. Originality/value: The findings related to the information experiences of immigrants consulting informal networks has potential implications for research in various discipline such as LIS, migrational studies and psychology that explore the benefits of social networks in newcomers' settlement. The study also sets a ground to take a more holistic approach to the information experiences of newcomers, not just naming the sources newcomers utilize in settlement and everyday life contexts. The study also provides some future directions to comprehensively understand the culturally situated information behaviour of various immigrant groups. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the post-internet era, the Web has become a conventional Medium for information seeking. Due to the pervasive role of the web in information seeking many scholars have studied its different aspects. The purpose of this study is to further extend the scope of information seeking research by examining the role of the characteristics of the Web (e.g., ease of navigation, ease of searching), properties of information (e.g., organization of information, quality of information, amount of information), and demographic factors in information seeking on the Web. A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from participants at a regional university. Descriptive as well as inferential statistics were used to analyze the responses. Notable impact of demographics such as gender and age was found in the use of the Web for information seeking. Specifically, it was found that females used the Web for information surfing more than the male participants and also preferred more the availability of information in different media formats. Age was found to be a significant influencer in terms of the importance placed on properties of information (e.g., quality of information) and characterizes of the Web (e.g., ease of search). Contrary to the common perceptions, it was found that as knowledge about computers increased the importance placed on convenience in finding information on the Web decreased. Authoritative offline information sources were still considered highly important in information seeking. The findings of this study will inform research on information seeking and will help information professionals to better facilitate users’ seeking of information on the Web. © 2022, University of the Punjab.

AB  - This paper discusses how the knowledge gained from information studies creates the possibility of dealing with the challenges of refugee integration. We demonstrate that a situation-focused approach creates a systemic understanding of information needs that is useful not only for the individual but also for the design of institutional responses to forced migration. We analysed findings from our research into refugee integration using the sense-making situation-gap approach and found micro- and macro-situations affecting information behaviour and use. The combined analysis of individual and contextual factors highlighted the characteristics of situations for actors, actions, interactions and events of context. We show that overarching situations faced by refugees determine individual information gap moments, and we discuss situational information behaviour in light of these findings. The findings show how a situational approach expands understanding in information studies and emphasises the depth information behaviour adds to the social and behavioural sciences. © 2020.

AB  - Human behaviour is complex and demographics are insufficient to understand information behaviour. More nuanced analyses are required to understand the factors that drive action. Focusing on digital archiving and online protection strategies as manifestations of information behaviour, factors that influence perceptions of online risk were investigated. The relationship between perception and behaviour was analyzed by focusing on people's risk responses and their archival habits. Using Bates’ theory of Information Behaviour, information behaviour paradoxes, what people do versus what they say they would do in online situations, were analyzed. By applying a mixed-method approach to 101 semi-structured interviews, individuals’ self-perceived internet skills and having a third-party negative experience are two key factors that influence perceptions of risk online. A three-part typology of internet users (cautiously optimistic offliners, confident onliners, and utopic onliners) is introduced. Perceptions of online risk have consequences for information behaviour and informs a theoretical modification. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - While there have been a growing number of studies on makerspaces in different disciplines, little is known about how young people interact with information in makerspaces. This study aimed to unpack how young people (middle and high schoolers) sought, used, and shared information in voluntary free-choice library makerspace activities. Qualitative methods, including individual interviews, observations, photovoice, and focus groups, were used to elicit 21 participants' experiences at two library makerspaces. The findings showed that young people engaged in dynamic practices of information seeking, use, and sharing, and revealed how the historical, sociocultural, material, and technological contexts embedded in makerspace activities shaped these information practices. Information practices of tinkering, sensing, and imagining in makerspaces were highlighted. Various criteria that young people used in evaluating human sources and online information were identified as well. The study also demonstrated the communicative and collaborative aspects of young people's information practices through information sharing. The findings extended Savolainen's everyday information practices model and addressed the gap in the current literature on young people's information behavior and information practices. Understanding how young people interact with information in makerspaces can help makerspace facilitators and information professionals better support youth services and facilitate makerspace activities. © 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - In the debate about what informs social work practice, research remains the dominant discourse. However, the relationship between research and social work practice has always been an uneasy one, arguably passed from other clinical disciplines without resizing to fit social work. Even as social work research matures as a discipline it represents one element in a much broader composite which informs practice. This article takes a unique step back from the traditional research-practice discourse and examines the broader information landscape of social work practice, asking how practitioners inform their practice, rather than how research informs practice. This study explores the information needs that prompt practitioners to search for information, the strategies they employ, their acquisition of information and the uses to which the information is put. This study aims to elucidate the information behaviour with a view to improving dissemination and use. Findings demonstrate that the social work information base is substantially broader than has been suggested. Practitioners employ a pragmatic palette of strategies to navigate the breadth of information that supports practice, from research through to knowledge sharing. This article proposes that a pragmatic framework of information behaviour is required to accurately reflect the information behaviour of social workers. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Academic Social Networking Sites (ASNSs) are increasingly used by scholars to create academic profiles, share research publications, and interact with peers, among many other functions. However, it remains unclear how factors such as discipline may affect the scholarly use of such sites. This study chose ResearchGate (RG) as the sample site and gathered data from a total of 77,902 users from 61 U.S. research universities at different research activity levels as defined by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The sample users were categorized into six groups based on their affiliated departmental discipline as stated on their RG profiles. The results show that user participation and RG use characteristics vary by discipline. In addition, users from higher research activity level universities tend to show better performance in RG metrics than their lower research activity level counterparts regardless of discipline. The findings of this study help ongoing efforts to better understand the use of ASNSs among researchers, assist researchers in effectively connecting and interacting with peers in their respective disciplines, and contribute to the discussion of ASNSs in the context of scholarly communication, altmetrics, and information behavior in research communities and higher education institutions. © 2020

AB  - The materiality of information environments, and its role in information behavior, has received little attention. We present an ethnographic study involving 156 hours of observation and 28 patient interviews in outpatient hemodialysis facilities. Using an extended “Semiotic Framework for Information Systems Research,” the findings show that objects, spaces, and bodies were integral to 6 sociomaterial layers of facility information environments: the physical, empiric, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and social world. Objects of importance in the information environments included dialysis machines, instruments, records, paper documents, televisions, furniture, thermostats, lighting, and personal possessions. Spatial features, including compartmentalization, displays, distance, proximity, and spatially-grounded routines, also constituted information environments. The information environments were also shaped by patient immobility, bodily discomforts, and orientation to bodily states. Each sociomaterial layer introduced enablers and constraints to information access, flow, and acceptance; these combined to construct patients primarily as passive recipients of information rather than active seekers and producers of information. A sociomaterial perspective and related focus on objects, spaces, and bodies offers a lens for professional information practice. We contribute information environment design guidance to facilitate such practice and stress that the value of certain sources and types of information can be materially encoded in an environment. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - Information source preferences of small-scale fishers can play a role in decision-making processes and affect the sustainability of small-scale fisheries. In this respect, determining useful communication tools to eliminate the information gaps and lack of information of fishers is important for sustainable and effective fisheries management. The purpose of this study was the determination of the preferred source of information and priorities of the small-scale fishers who operate along the Aegean Sea coast of Turkey. Data were collected from a random sample of 278 small-scale Turkish fishers located along the Aegean coastline via face-to-face interviews. Information source preferences of fishers were determined by Repertory Grid Technique. In the analysis, obtaining information about fisheries focused on three criteria such as marine ecology, fisheries technology, and fisheries policies. The level of importance given by fishers for each criterion was determined. Fishers prefer to get information from other fishers, followed by fishery cooperatives, and their own experiences (χ2 (11, n = 278) = 1305.920, P < 0.001). Fishery cooperatives are the closest organizations to fishers. The use of cooperatives as a source of information can be interpreted as an element that can facilitate access to information when evaluated through the “availability” of behavioral economics. Fishery cooperatives, which stand out in fishers’ information source preferences, have the potential to be a valuable source of information in all aspects. The results of the research are thought to benefit researchers from non-governmental organizations, research institutes, and universities that carry out national and international projects with fishers. © Denizcan Durgun et al.

AB  - This study investigated consumers’ information-avoidance behavior in the context of a public health emergency—the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, it proposes a model for exploring the effects of external stimuli (perceived threat and perceived information overload) related to COVID-19 on consumers’ internal states (sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance) and their subsequent behavioral intentions to avoid health information and engage in preventive behaviors. With a survey sample (N = 721), we empirically examined the proposed model and tested the hypotheses. The results indicate that sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance, which were a result of perceived threat and perceived information overload, had heterogeneous effects on information avoidance. Anxiety and cognitive dissonance increased information avoidance intention, while sadness decreased information avoidance intention. Moreover, information avoidance predicted a reluctance on the part of consumers to engage in preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings not only contribute to the information behavior literature and extend the concept of information avoidance to a public health emergency context, but also yield practical insights for global pandemic control. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The proliferation of digital devices and connectivity enables people to work anywhere, anytime, even while they are on the move. While mobile applications have become pervasive, an excessive amount of mobile applications have been installed on mobile devices. Nowadays, commuting takes a large proportion of daily human life, but studies show that searching for the desired apps while commuting can decrease productivity significantly and sometimes even cause safety issues. Although app usage behaviour has been studied for general situations, little to no study considers the commuting context as vital information. Existing models for app usage prediction cannot be easily generalised across all commuting contexts due to: (1) continuous change in user locations; and (2) limitation of necessary contextual information (i.e., lack of knowledge to identify which contextual information is necessary for different commuting situations. We aim to address these challenges by extracting essential contextual information for on-commute app usage prediction. Using the extracted features, we propose AppUsageOTM, a practical statistical machine learning framework to predict both destination amenity and utilise the inferred destination to contextualise the app usage prediction with travelling purposes as crucial information. We evaluate our framework in terms of accuracy, which shows the feasibility of our work. Using a real-world mobile and app usage behaviour dataset with more than 12,495 trajectory records and more than 1046 mobile applications logged, AppUsageOTM significantly outperformed all baseline models, achieving Accuracy@k 46.4%@1, 66.4%@5, and 75.9%@10. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In producing news stories, journalists depend on information obtained from sources. This paper reviews the literature on journalists’ information seeking. The 90 studies included in the review cover how journalists identify sources, interact with sources, interpret information, and manage sources. In addition to quality and accessibility, balance in the group of sources selected is an important criterion in journalists’ identification of sources. However, the importance journalists assign to balance stands in contrast to the frequent finding of bias in their source selections. In interactions with sources, the sources frequently provide ideas for new stories in addition to information for current ones. This finding shows how multiple instances of information seeking coexist and combine into a mesh of intersecting information-seeking processes. In interpreting information, journalists are acutely aware that sources may have an agenda or be misinformed. While journalists praise information checking, they regularly bypass it or replace direct checks for information quality with indirect checks, such as whether the source appears trustworthy. In managing sources, journalists engage in boundary work to regulate their relationship with sources. They also cultivate long-term relationships with selected sources. The review findings are discussed with respect to how journalism shapes journalists’ information seeking and what implications the findings have for information-behavior research in other domains. © 2022

AB  - This article examines the historical expansion and convergence of the fields of information behavior and human–computer interaction, primarily in terms of the philosophy underlying each field. Information behavior grew out of research in library service provision in the early 1900s, and human–computer interaction grew out of computer science and human factors engineering in the 1960s. While these two fields have had different origins, purposes, and discourses, in recent decades, they have begun to converge. In this article, we map this convergence and consider implications for the future of the information field. We conceptualize their scholarly paradigms as expanding circles, and we show that the circles of information behavior and human–computer interaction are expanding in terms of ontology, epistemology, and axiology—and moreover, they are beginning to overlap substantially. While the two fields continue to be largely separate in terms of scholarly discourses, we suggest that much could be gained by explicitly acknowledging their shared components. Some suggestions for this are discussed, and these are connected to the ongoing iSchool Movement. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Information behavior in activities that are freely chosen has been little explored. This article conceptualizes personally meaningful activities as a site for information behavior research. Personal meaning is discussed as a necessity for human beings. In the information age, there is an ethical directive for developers of information technology to promote and afford personally meaningful activities. This article builds on discussions of the pleasurable and profound in information science conceptually and empirically. First, it argues for the necessity of phenomenology in these discussions, which heretofore has been mostly absent. Next, it presents results from a qualitative, empirical study on information in personally meaningful activities. The empirical study uses interpretative phenomenological analysis to examine information experience in three domains of personal meaning: Bible reading, ultramarathon running, and art-making. The following themes emerge and are discussed: identity, central practice, curiosity, and presence. Opportunities for technological development and further research are outlined. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - Purpose: This article examines the relation between place, space and information behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: Concepts of place and space are explored through a comparison of three leisure pursuits: running, urban exploration and genealogy, based on the authors' research and the published literature. Findings: A socially constructed meaning of place is central to each leisure activity but how it is experienced physically, emotionally and imaginatively are different. Places have very different meanings within each practice. Mirroring this, information behaviours are also very different: such as the sources used, the type of information created and how it is shared or not shared. Information behaviour contributes to the meanings associated with place in particular social practices. Research limitations/implications: Meaning attached to place can be understood as actively constructed within social practices. Rather than context for information behaviours in the sense of an outside, containing, even constraining, environment, the meaning of place can be seen as actively constructed within social practices and by the information behaviours that are part of them. Originality/value: The paper adds a new perspective to the understanding of place and space in the study of information behaviour. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Information complexity issues such as poor data integration and quality and timely access to information can impair the implementation of information artifacts. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are an information artifact used to guide a patient's care delivery over time. Despite evidence on the effectiveness of CPGs, they remain underutilized in certain contexts of medicine. One such example is colorectal cancer screening where disparities in screening rates and incidences of colorectal cancer are particularly prevalent between rural and urban populations. To address that issue, we need to better understand the information complexity factors that impact CPG implementation. This paper addresses the above shortcoming and uses a case study of colorectal cancer screening in remote and rural Northern Canada to develop a systems approach for modeling health information complexity. We describe a set of health information system components and interrelationships and a method for system mapping using the system components and interrelationships. We then provide exploratory system models from our case study and use them to characterize health information complexity according to interaction complexity and information behavior complexity. Our results highlight that information artifacts such as CPGs are not complex per se, but rather confounding factors is what causes information complexity. Our findings have implications for modeling information complexity and the design of policy and technological solutions to address health information complexity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dissertations can be important sources of information about the future of a research field. These publications capture the ideas, theories, methods, and populations that emerging researchers deem important for study. Dissertation research often exhibits great rigor and innovation. This study of dissertations focuses on one specific field, which has importance in a large variety of academic disciplines: information behavior. An analysis of a sample of information behavior dissertations published in ProQuest Dissertations and Theses between 2009 and 2018 is performed. The top theories, methods, and study populations are identified using data functions to compile the results. While the majority of information behavior research originates in the discipline of library and information science (53%), the field is nonetheless highly interdisciplinary. The theories of Kuhlthau, Dervin, and Wilson are used extensively as frameworks in information behavior dissertations. Students are the most commonly studied population, while interview is the most commonly utilized research method. Information behavior is a diverse research field, stemming from a large number of disciplines and utilizing a broad group of theories, methods, and populations. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In recent years, more and more government administrations around the world are participating in open data policy implementation. Government officials who are charged with implementing this new policy usually need to look for related information for deciding what datasets to open to the public. Accordingly, a research gap exists in understanding government officials' information behaviors in implementing open data policy. By using a qualitative approach to conduct semi-structured interviews with government officials who have extensive experience in implementing open data policy, this study explores government officials' information behaviors in searching and selecting datasets for open data publication. Specifically, this research investigates government officials' information needs, the employed information sources, and the intervening variables that influence their information behaviors. While open data is an ongoing policy implementation, government officials' information behaviors form an iterative cycle where information needs continually occur, information seeking activities are conducted by using a variety of information sources, and the obtained information is used to satisfy information needs. The findings and discussions of this study are expected to provide insights of government officials' data search and selection to practitioners and to enrich the current literature of open government data. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This research aimed (1) to study and analyze the ability of current information retrieval (IR) systems based on views of information behavior (IB), and (2) to propose a conceptual framework for an IB model based on the collaboration between the system and user, with the intent of developing an IR system that can apply intelligent techniques to enhance system efficiency. The methods in this study consisted of (1) document analysis which included studying the characteristics and efficiencies of the current IR systems and studying the IB models in the digital environment, and (2) implementation of the Delphi technique through an in-depth interview method with experts. The research results were presented in three main parts. First, the IB model was categorized into eight stages, different from traditional IB, in the digital environment, which can correspond to all behaviors and be applied to with an IR system. Second, insufficient functions and log file storage hinder the system from effectively understanding and accommodating user behavior in the digital environment. Last, the proposed conceptual framework illustrated that there are stages that can add intelligent techniques to the IR system based on the collaboration perspective between the user and system to boost the users’ cognitive ability and make the IR system more user-friendly. Importantly, the conceptual framework for the IB model based on the collaboration perspective between the user and system for IR assisted the ability of information systems to learn, recognize, and comprehend human IB according to individual characteristics, leading to enhancement of interaction between the system and users. © 2020.

AB  - Permeating the Internet and reaching millions of users, fake news became a pervasive phenomenon on the public agenda since the US Presidential election in 2016. The term, despite its ambiguity, has been widely used in research to describe false messages created with the intent to mislead. However empirical evidence on how fake news spreads and circulates between individuals and different social groups remains limited. For this literature review, I collected 21 academic articles published in English between 2016 and 2020 that explore the audience of fake news, patterns of its dissemination, and the role played by average users and bots in this process. The reviewed studies sometimes arrive at contradictory conclusions regarding important aspects of the focal phenomenon: for example, authors differently evaluate the scale of it and reach opposing conclusions studying the influence of bots on the fake news spread. Moreover, I observe certain contextual imbalances: many papers focus on the US political agenda and collect data from Facebook or Twitter, all but neglecting other digital platforms where disinformation can circulate. In this paper, I argue that future research needs a systematic exploration of users' motivations to share fake news and more precise look into the role of media in misinformation dissemination. It is also important to compare the spread of fake news within different political contexts and media systems to explore how local peculiarities affect its circulation.

AB  - Purpose: This paper introduces more-than-human perspective in information behaviour and information experience studies. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to understandings of the concept of multispecies families by exploring their significant dimensions related to information phenomena involving multiple contexts, situations, spaces, actors, species, and activities. Design/methodology/approach: Based on previous research in human information behaviour and human-animal studies, our ideas around information experience of multispecies families are developed conceptually. The paper builds both on previous empirical findings about human information behaviour and the new domain of information experience. Findings: The paper proposes a holistic approach both to information phenomena in everyday living with companion animals including embodied, affective, cognitive, social, digital, and objectual information that shapes pet care and management practices, and to the context of study, including work, domestic, and leisure aspects of multispecies family. Originality/value: This study broadens our understanding of information phenomena in multispecies families, and so contributes to the field of information experience. It also provides insights for animal welfare scientists to help them understand the information behaviour of humans who are responsible for keeping and caring for animals. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: To elaborate the nature of infotainment as a mediating concept between information and entertainment by analysing how the concept of infotainment is approached in diverse domains such as communication research. Design/methodology/approach: Conceptual analysis was conducted by focussing on 41 key studies on the topic. First, it was examined how researchers have approached the relationships between informational and entertaining elements of infotainment. Thereafter, attention was directed to the ways in which people make use of infotainment. The conceptual analysis is based on the comparison of the similarities and differences between the characterizations of the above issues. Findings: Early studies characterized infotainment in terms of soft news which is distinct from hard news offering factual information. Later investigations offer a more nuanced picture by approaching infotainment as phenomenon with diverse dimensions depicting the topics, focus and presentation style. Studies on the use of infotainment offer contradictory evidence of the extent to which infotaining programmes can increase people's interest in social, political and health issues, for example. Research limitations/implications: As the study concentrates on the analysis of an individual concept, that is, infotainment, the findings cannot be generalized to concern the ways in which informational and entertaining phenomena are related as a whole. Originality/value: By elaborating the conceptual nature of infotainment, the study contributes to information behaviour research by refining the picture of the relationships between information and entertainment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Mobile searches have become the main channel for people to search for information, and mobile searches have received attention in the field of information-seeking behavior. Especially as users use various apps to search network information, the app-switching behaviors in mobile searches have also attracted scholars’ attention in recent years. Research on app-switching behaviors in mobile searches can help to further understand users’ search motivations, evaluate search results, and improve users’ mobile search experiences. This study recruited participants (n = 30) and conducted a 15-day user experiment. This study collected all participants’ mobile phone log data during the experiment and identified the app-switching behaviors in mobile searches through a log collection tool. This study aimed to discover the app-switching behavior paths and patterns in mobile searches. Firstly, the basic characteristics of app-switching behaviors in mobile searches were analyzed, as were the app-switching paths in mobile searches from the perspective of switching probability between apps. Then, the different behaviors in mobile search sessions were identified and app-switching behavior patterns were put forward. These behavior patterns summarize user behavior changes in mobile search sessions. This paper focused on analyzing app-switching behavior paths under different patterns and found apparent differences in app-switching behavior paths. This study examined mobile search behavior from the perspective of app-switching. The research of this paper can help to better understand the relationship between users’ mobile search behaviors and app interactions and is an excellent supplement to the analysis of mobile search behaviors. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Although open government data (OGD) are becoming widely available, they have not yet reached their full potential due to their limited use. Supplementing OGD with visualizations can make data more engaging, useful, and understandable. We synthesized the academic research on the development and evaluation of OGD visualizations in the IEEE Explore, Science Direct, and ACM Digital Library databases. Our findings suggest four streams of research: 1) description and evaluation of specific examples of OGD visualization, 2) general tools and frameworks, 3) users' needs assessments and evaluation of usability, and 4) other user-related outcomes. While there is a growing robust literature describing specific cases, further empirical research is needed on evaluating the usability of OGD visualizations and tools for different audiences. Promising strategies to enhance the usability and usefulness of OGD are to employ advanced OGD platforms with embedded visualizations and analytics tools and to collaborate with research centers on user studies to ensure that visualizations and analytic tools are useful for stakeholders. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Parents as primary socialization agents have a major influence on the development of children. The facilities that can be used to maximize child development are libraries. Libraries are information centers that help meet information needs. This research aims to identify information behavior of children using public libraries in Taiwan and Indonesia and the role of parents as a child's primary socialization agents for library utilization. This study was conducted in Taichung City-Taiwan and Surabaya-Indonesia. Both cities are cities of literation and the second largest cities in each country. The libraries provided in both cities have special services for children. The method used is descriptive research with purposive sampling. The samples were parents who had invited their children to the library at least 2 times in the last month. Questionnaires were given directly to parents in the children's library services. The number of respondents was 200 respondents: 100 in Taichung-Taiwan and 100 in Surabaya-Indonesia. In addition to the collection of primary data through questionnaires, data collection was also conducted via interviews with the library staff, library website, and other secondary data. The results of this study show that the role of parents is very significant to increase child's interest in reading through the use of libraries. Therefore, it is necessary for libraries to invite parents to socialize the utilization of the library to meet the information needs of children. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The study was undertaken to investigate the utilisation of electronic information resources of the UNECA library in Addis Ababa Ethiopia and the challenges faced by the different users. A quantitative research method with a sample survey research design was applied. A population of 600 users, of which 500 were internal users (UNECA and United Nations agencies staff members) and 100 were external users (researchers, students, or non-staff members). 20% from each category was taken as a sample. An online questionnaire was distributed through email to collect data. The total response rate was 74%. The results showed that 92% of the respondents were aware of the availability of the electronic resources of the Library. 94% found the electronic resources useful. 84% confirmed that the resources were easy to use. High numbers of the respondents positively agreed that the quality of their outputs and performances have improved as a result of these resources. The challenges associated with the resources include information overload, access restriction with IP address, lack of training and remembering login credentials. 68% reported that the library services met their expectations. The study recommends the development of strategies for enhancing accessibility and discoverability of the resources, providing information literacy trainings for all users, and finding alternative measures for IP restriction access. © 2021

AB  - The relationship between information and control interests social scientists; however, much prior work has focused on organizations rather than families. Work on interactive information behaviors has also focused on organizations and on collaboration rather than conflict. Therefore, in families managing chronic illness, we investigated information behaviors in the context of health-related social control and the impact of control on patient health behavior. We conducted a qualitative analysis of interviews with 38 family groups and 97 individuals over 2 years. Findings revealed conflictual information behavior, which led to competitions for control and influence between family members and patients. In response to perceived patient health behavior-related problems, family members sought, shared, and used information for social control of patients by enforcing norms, leveraging expertise, performing surveillance, and structuring the environment. These behaviors clashed with patients' interests and perspectives drawn from their own information acquisition. Patients responded by assessing family-presented information and using information to resist or appease norm enforcement, refute or agree with expertise, and permit or block surveillance. Over time, some patient behaviors changed; alternatively, patients blocked family access to information about themselves, or family members retreated. The results challenge presumptions of benefit and harmony that have characterized much prior information behavior research. © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - Wearable technology has been a news-friendly trend in the past decade, particularly given the popularity of, and attendant concerns with, digital fitness trackers. One type of wearable technology, the GoPro camera, has become widely known for enabling first-person views of athletic feats such as skiing and surfing. Recently, such cameras have begun to be applied within social science research. This visual presentation offers a unique report on the sustainable integration of a GoPro into data collection for a qualitative study of everyday-life information practices. The presentation details the walking tour method into which the camera has been integrated, as well as the technical and ethical considerations involved in implementation.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the placement of the skill of reading in models devoted to information behaviour and information literacy process frameworks, with particular attention to children and young people. Design/methodology/approach: The work is based on an analysis of pertinent literature that has been published over a period of some 80 years. The sources include monographs, essays in books, academic journal papers, conference proceedings and articles in professional periodicals. Findings: Much thinking on information behaviour tends to assume that reading takes place either for leisure purposes or to support study, whilst information literacy (IL) frameworks typically either emphasise higher-order reading skills or present generic stages in which reading is subsumed within a category of more abstract action. Many IL models implicitly assume that the individual has already mastered the fundamentals of reading. Research limitations/implications: Although extensive, the author’s literature review is by no means exhaustive. It does not refer to all models of either information behaviour or information literacy. Practical implications: Information professionals need to acknowledge the true variety of motivations that prompt young people to read, and those responsible for information literacy instruction must determine how far they view their role as providing teaching in basic reading skills. Originality/value: The paper is unusual in examining reading from two quite different perspectives - those of information behaviour and information literacy - and, despite its academic orientation, concludes with a range of suggestions intended to be of use to practising librarians. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Th aim of the paper is to present findings of a study on information sources and information behavior of doctoral students at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing at the University of Zagreb, Croatia. The study also looked into student perceptions of the role of the academic library and their attitudes toward it as a legitimate partner in the research process, as doctoral students are required to publish the results of their doctoral research in high-ranking peer-reviewed journals during their course of study. However, they rarely use the library and its services; the study was undertaken with the intent to obtain insight into the students' information behavior as well as needs and reasons for overlooking the library as a relevant partner in their research process. The online survey was conducted on a sample of 138 postgraduate students, with semi-structured interviews with five postgraduate students also conducted. The findings show a dominant student orientation towards online sources such as online databases and Google Scholar. Students tend to overlook the library as a relevant information source but have positive attitudes toward librarians (their knowledge, skills and courtesy). The library needs to become more active in promoting its services and, especially in the domain of postgraduate education, needs to be regarded as a necessary location for any serious research work, where librarians are regarded as cooperating partners in the research process. There were a few limitations of the study: respondents were unwilling to dedicate their time to this research and therefore the interviews were too short to examine the topics discussed in-depth, while the sample was extremely homogeneous, making the results only in part transferable to other contexts. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Bloggers in the postmodern era can influence the behaviour of consumers and alter their perceptions. The current study looks at the blogger influence phenomenon from a different theoretical perspective than existing literature did. By combining information behaviour and communication theory, it proposes a new conceptual framework by relying on the characteristics of the blogger, the blog content, motivation, and goals of information seeker. In this model, information seekers’ objectives and issue the involvement are important drivers of blog selection and determinants of the blog's influence. The framework was empirically tested in a sample of American users of beauty blogs. The results provide a confirmation of the postulated relationships. Three types of blog visits are identified and their effects and their attributes that make a blog influential are examined. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Texas has experienced levels of seismicity comparable to areas of California in recent years, and seismologists suggest that the increased activity in Texas is likely the result of human activities associated with oil and gas extraction. However, the general public is largely unaware of induced seismicity and related risks. To better understand this lack of awareness and how it might be addressed, we sought guidance from Kahlor's (2010)planned risk information seeking model to explore the social-psychological factors that are likely to influence Texan's intentions to seek information about the potential risks posed by earthquakes. We test the model using data collected from residents in five Texas communities that have varied experiences with seismicity. The data supports the model: the variance in intentions to seek information about earthquake risks were largely explained by positive attitudes towards seeking such information, perceived control over the ability to seek such information, perceived social pressure related to seeking such information, perceived earthquake risks, risk-related emotion (e.g., worry)and a perceived need for more information about earthquake risks. The study highlights the applicability of this risk information-seeking model to the context of seismic risk, and suggests ways in which scientists and communicators might engage the public more effectively with the topic. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Professional work is often regulated by procedures that shape the information seeking involved in performing a task. Yet, research on professionals’ information seeking tends to bypass procedures and depict information seeking as an informal activity. In this study we analyze two healthcare tasks governed by procedures: triage and timeouts. While information seeking is central to both procedures, we find that the coordinating nurses rarely engage in information seeking when they triage patients. Inversely, the physicians value convening for timeouts to seek information. To explain these findings we distinguish between junior and expert professionals and between uncertain and equivocal tasks. The triage procedure specifies which information to retrieve but expert professionals such as the coordinating nurses tend to perform triage, which is an uncertain task, by holistic pattern recognition rather than information seeking. For timeouts, which target an equivocal task, the procedure facilitates information seeking by creating a space for open-ended collaborative reflection. Both junior and expert physicians temporarily suspend patient treatment in favor of this opportunity to reflect on their actions, though partly for different reasons. We discuss implications for models of professionals’ information seeking. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This investigation examines perceptions of normality emerging from two distinct studies of information behavior associated with life disrupting health symptoms and theorizes the search for normality in the context of sense making theory. Study I explored the experiences of women striving to make sense of symptoms associated with menopause; Study II examined posts from two online discussion groups for people with symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder. Joint data analysis demonstrates that normality was initially perceived as the absence of illness. A breakdown in perceived normality because of disruptive symptoms created gaps and discontinuities in understanding. As participants interacted with information about the experiences of health-challenged peers, socially constructed notions of normality emerged. This was internalized as a “new normal.” Findings demonstrate normality as an element of sense making that changes and develops over time, and experiential information and social contexts as central to health-related sense making. Re-establishing perceptions of normality, as experienced by health-challenged peers, was an important element of sense making. This investigation provides nuanced insight into notions of normality, extends understanding of social processes involved in sense making, and represents the first theorizing of and model development for normality within the information science and sense making literature. © 2016 ASIS&T

AB  - This article describes information finding practices of financial professionals from five countries in the Arabian Gulf Region. Participants reported company information as the most important type of information, while other main types include country information, information on investment opportunities, and cross-linkages with operational facilities. Wikis, blogs, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook were among the frequently used social media. Need for subscriptions for some sources appeared to be the main concern hindering information finding. Frequently used business information sources should be accessible to financial professionals on regular basis through in-house facilities or outsourcing. Accessibility of information and enhanced information literacy will result in considerable savings for business organizations. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © Abdus Sattar Chaudhry and Husain Al-Ansari.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the creation of a holistic picture of information behavior by examining the connections between information seeking and sharing. Design/methodology/approach: Conceptual analysis is used to focus on the ways in which the researchers have modeled the interplay of information seeking and sharing. The study draws on conceptual analysis of 27 key studies examining the above issue, with a focus on the scrutiny of six major models for information behavior. Findings: Researchers have employed three main approaches to model the relationships between information seeking and sharing. The indirect approach conceptualizes information seeking and sharing as discrete activities connected by an intermediating factor, for example, information need. The sequential approach assumes that information seeking precedes information sharing. From the viewpoint of the interactive approach, information seeking and sharing appear as mutually related activities shaping each other iteratively or in a cyclical manner. The interactive approach provides the most sophisticated research perspective on the relationships of information seeking and sharing and contributes to holistic understanding of human information behavior. Research limitations/implications: As the study focuses on information seeking and sharing, no attention is devoted to other activities constitutive of information behavior, for example, information use. Originality/value: The study pioneers by providing an in-depth analysis of the connections of information seeking and information sharing. © 2019, Reijo Savolainen.

AB  - This paper examines issues associated with secondary analysis of qualitative data and their implications for information behaviour scholarship. Secondary data analysis poses a range of potential challenges for data creators, but also opportunities, including the ability to expand theory to a wider context, strengthen the reliability and validity of existing theory, gain access to populations that may be difficult to access, and to promote data archiving. The paper uses as a case study of secondary data analysis the results from our re-examination of data gathered previously in the European Union project Net Children Go Mobile, drawing from the interview transcripts from the 34 children in the UK data set. Our approach to secondary analysis was reanalysis, applying a new interpretive lens to the data that necessitated new questions in order to reveal hidden layers in the data. The data was analysed for evidence of information behaviour in order to understand how mobile technologies may be changing the way that young people seek and use information. The reanalysis of the data set supported existing models of information behaviour but revealed new ways of information seeking based on the affordances of screen size and data plans. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the information culture of Ghanaian immigrants living in New Zealand. The values, beliefs and behaviours that influence the ways information is identified, accessed, used, shared and preserved, defines people’s information culture. Some Ghanaians have migrated to New Zealand for different reasons, including studies, work and resettlement. To live successfully and peacefully in a foreign country, they need specific information and to understand where to find, use and share it. This paper investigated the factors that influence the beliefs and perspectives Ghanaians hold around information the information they use in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach was adopted. Both questionnaire and interviews were used to collect data from 27 Ghanaians living in different regions of New Zealand. Basic questionnaire analysis was done in survey monkey. Interview transcripts were analysed manually by reading through severally using colour patterns to identify key concepts and themes and using tables to organise them. Findings: The main areas Ghanaians are interested in using information about in New Zealand include education, health, information on environmental issues, New Zealand politics and sports. Few Ghanaians are interested in information about entertainment and religion and agriculture as these areas do not have much impact on the purposes for their lives in New Zealand. Although most Ghanaians consider themselves poor record-keepers, they accord high value to the information they seek and use in New Zealand. Their preferred information source is the World Wide Web, although other sources such as libraries and academic databases are also considered useful. The most preferred and trusted approach of sharing information is face-to-face is considered. Social media, WhatsApp, mobile phones, etc. are also considered reliable ways of communicating information. Research limitations/implication: Only 27 Ghanaians participated in the study, their circumstances surrounding the life in New Zealand may be completely different from other Ghanaians. So their views may not fully reflect the situations of all Ghanaians in New Zealand. Also, the fact that most participants were familiar with the researcher could impact their responses. Practical implication: This paper provides a useful understanding of the information cultural patterns of Ghanaians and can provide a useful basis for further investigations of Ghanaians and other immigrants’ life patterns in New Zealand. Originality/value: Although other studies have looked at the Ghanaian immigrants in other countries, this is the first study that looks at the information culture of Ghanaians in New Zealand. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper is the first to present a study of information behavior of Latinos in the Midwestern U.S. It begins addressing gaps in knowledge about Latinos, particularly immigrants, and their information seeking and use of the mobile, social web in rural areas of the U.S. Midwest. Interviews were conducted in 2016 and 2017 with 20 Midwestern Latinos – 15 immigrants to the United States and five native-born. We find that interviewees use many well-known social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube as well as online resources to meet their information needs. Many prefer to consult trusted sources, making social media access desirable. Midwestern Latinos have adopted a number of the same information seeking practices as other immigrants and marginalized peoples, which may be different from practices of dominant populations in rural areas. Given their preferences, Latinos we interviewed will be best served by access to trusted information in the languages they speak, often presented orally such as in video format. For this, a reliable internet connection and internet-enabled device are key. © Denice Adkins and Heather Moulaison Sandy

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate information seeking behaviour of people involved in slow and flash flood disasters, specifically how they received the first alert, where they then turned for more information, and what their main sources and forms were. An online and mailed survey based on models of problem-specific information seeking and risk information for natural hazards secured responses from Australians who had experienced flash flood (n = 91) and slow flood (n = 41). It found that information pathways taken by individuals are different for slow and flash floods, but the set of information forms and sources used are similar. ‘Other people’ television and news and weather websites were predominant sources and forms in flash flood, and online sources, television and radio predominant in slow flood. The importance of other people and mainstream media (including their online sites) in information behaviour means that mainstream media should remain an important component of information efforts by agencies. This study builds further evidence that disaster type and the media landscape should be taken into account when developing warning and response communication strategies, and allows public information officers to prioritise communication forms during response. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We focus on the roles that institutions play relative to information behavior. Our working definition of institution is the formal and informal constraints that form the basis for exchange, relationships, and decision-making. We know that institutions play significant roles in the creation, management, and uses of information. And, scholars have long recognized that institutions have both direct and indirect impacts on the sustainability and ethical value of information. What is less clear are the ways in which institutions and people's information behaviors are mutually-constituted. The goal of this panel is to highlight particular opportunities for expanding the current and modest level of attention to studying the roles of human institutions relative to information. To do so, this panel will involve the audience in a lively conversation about how information science views the role of institutions in information behavior. It includes a participatory design structured activity that will engage the audience in identifying how existing threads of research are making contributions and key areas of further inquiry. The panel will begin with dialogue sharing insights of scholars and practitioners who are interested in data governance, information behavior, organization of information, and knowledge management. Then the panel will engage the audience in an interactive activity that explores emerging research streams and questions. Copyright © 2018 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - The paper reports on factors that drive students' perceived self-efficacy in information seeking practices through Facebook. The quantitative study employed random sampling of postgraduate students in a higher learning institution. A total of 354 responses were gathered through a self-reported survey. The findings showed four factors, namely, past performance, other's experience, verbal persuasion and psychological state, have statistically significant correlations with students' perceived self-efficacy in information seeking practices through Facebook. Past performance was found to be the most influential factor followed by other's experience. Verbal persuasion and psychological states were the least influential factor. The outcome of the study contributes to the existing literature particularly on the self-efficacy standpoint in social networking sites (SNS) platform. In addition, the findings are relevant to the field of information seeking behaviour especially in providing evidence that people are searching information using Facebook. © 2003, Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology, University of Malaya.

More seriously, these groups are targeting youth using religiously significant terms described with distorted interpretations. The discourse of these groups presents a romanticized view of destruction, trivializes loss of life and breeds hatred to anyone adhering to a different set of values. These extremist groups pose three important risks to communities: (1) influencing public perception and gaining silent sympathizers, (2) creating a sense of us versus them which then leads to discord and identity conflicts and (3) radicalizing and/or recruiting youth. This research presents a digital prototype developed in a 3D-environment, based on research concerning informational and affective properties of extremists' content, with an objective to educate youth against extremism.

AB  - The authors discuss the relationship between information seeking and epistemic beliefs–beliefs about the source, structure, complexity and stability of knowledge–in the context of collaborative information-seeking discourses. They further suggest that both information seeking, and epistemic cognition research agendas, have suffered from a lack of attention to how information seeking as a collaborative activity is mediated by talk between partners–an area they seek to address in this article. A small-scale observational study using sociocultural discourse analysis was conducted with eight 11-year-old pupils who carried out search engine tasks in small groups. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were performed on their discussions using sociocultural discourse analytic techniques. Extracts of the dialogue are reported, informed by concordance analysis and quantitative coding of dialogue duration. The authors find that: (1) discourse which could be characterised as ‘epistemic’ is identifiable in student talk; (2) it is possible to identify talk which is more or less productive; and (3) epistemic talk is associated with positive learning outcomes. © 2016 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.

AB  - Background: From a life course perspective, pregnancy leads to a rise in nutrition awareness and an increase in information flow in favour of adopting healthier eating behaviours. This qualitative study was designed to better understand the determinants of eating behaviours in French pregnant women by focusing on their concerns, attitudes and beliefs and their nutrition-related information seeking practices. Methods: Seven focus groups were conducted, involving a total of 40 French pregnant women. An inductive thematic approach, adapted from the grounded theory, was adopted to analyse the data. Two major themes were identified: eating behaviour and nutrition-related information behaviour. Results: The eating behaviour theme was divided into four sub-themes using the attribution theory. Three external causes affected the eating behaviour of pregnant women (food restrictions, physiological changes and weight gain), and led to frustration and a perceived loss of control. By contrast the adoption of a healthier diet was perceived as internal by pregnant women, and resulted in self-fulfilment and empowerment regarding the health and the well-being of their baby and themselves, and their weight gain management. Greater attention was paid to nutrition-related information obtained from healthcare providers, the social environment and the mass media. Information was passively absorbed or actively sought by pregnant women, but most was perceived as contradictory, which led to confusion. Conclusion: Pregnancy is accompanied by a rise in nutrition awareness, substantiated by eating behaviour modifications due to external and internal causes. However, conflicts between and within information sources result in confusion that can limit the adoption of healthier eating behaviour. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - As practitioners of new forms of consumption and production, fans represent an important area for research. Specifically, fans of “transmedia systems” – media-hopping networks of intertextualities that extend the narrative world of an original production – employ unique tactics for negotiating a complex information space. The study of such tactics provides valuable insights on the everyday information behaviors of modern post-digital readers and media consumers that could benefit literacy and community engagement. Despite this, fans have received little attention in the information behavior literature. Therefore, this paper seeks to contribute new empirical understandings of the transmedia fan to the information behavior domain. The author undertook a pilot case study of the Game of Thrones transmedia fandom. Using a grounded theory approach, the qualitative coding of 400 online user comments revealed four types of tactics employed by fans to negotiate the transmedia system: sentimental, reasoned, relational and comic. A discussion of these tactics and the ways in which fans use them results in a preliminary definition and information behavior cycle model for the transmedia fan. The study's findings offer key observations about the everyday information behavior of fans and about reading and media consumption practices in general.

AB  - This study examines the ways in which transnational city newcomers interact with locative technology to build knowledge about their urban surroundings. We conducted semistructured interviews with 25 transnational migrants recently relocated to the greater New York City area, investigating their day-to-day smartphone use, navigation tactics, and uses of location-based services. Our analysis reflects on three themes: tensions surrounding different navigation strategies (searching vs. browsing); social monitoring practices (awareness vs. surveillance); and perceptions of online information sources (credibility/trust vs. distrust). Together, these themes highlight the contradictory outcomes of technology use both facilitating and hindering the processes of urban learning. We conclude with a discussion of paradoxical outcomes of technological use as a means of unpacking the sociotechnical tensions that emerge from locative technology use among transnational migrants in new urban environments. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - From the vantage point of user studies and the information literacy paradigm, a case study was conducted (at the Universitat Jaume I, Castellón, Spain) to analyse the information behaviour of first-year Translation trainees. The study takes into account what it is like to be a university student in the digital age, in order to investigate how they find, evaluate and use information for their course work. The study is located within the qualitative paradigm (using a semi-structured task to obtain direct data from the student body). A number of needs and weaknesses are identified within the student group as regards their information behaviour. It is hoped that this study will serve as a basis for the design and subsequent implementation of Information Literacy programmes specific to this interdisciplinary field. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report on an exploratory study of third-year architecture students’ information behaviour. It focusses on information activities, personal experience, resource usage, preferences in working individually or collaboratively, preferences for information resources inspiring creativity and physical spaces to be creative. Design/methodology/approach: It was a mixed methods study with a strongly qualitative component and limited descriptive quantitative data. Data were collected in October 2016 at a South African university using individual self-administered questionnaires and semi-structured individual interviews; 19 out of 60 (response rate 32 per cent) third-year architecture students doing a design project participated. Findings: Creativity is important in architecture projects, as is information resources in stimulating creativity. Students preferred to work individually during their design projects; at times collaboration was needed for idea generation. Information activities included: information gathering, encountering, use and sharing. A range of theoretical, technical, artistic and practical skills and knowledge must be integrated to produce creative outcomes, in addition, to information searching and information usage. Factual information is also required. Students can benefit from a supportive information rich creative space (physical or virtual). Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted at only one institution with a small number of participants. Although generalisation of findings is not possible, issues for further research can be noted. Practical implications: Designers of physical and virtual creative spaces must take into account different facets of information behaviour and the information resources and services required during creative information-seeking activities. Originality/value: Although there is literature on information behaviour and creativity, the authors could not find any that explores architecture students’ information behaviour in academic spaces of creativity. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reconsider the role of the body in information in serious leisure by reviewing existing work in information behaviour that theorises the role of the body, and by drawing selectively on literature from beyond information studies to extend our understanding. Design/methodology/approach: After finding a lack of attention to the body in most influential works on information behaviour, the paper identifies a number of important authors who do offer theorisations. It then explores what can be learnt by examining studies of embodied information in the hobbies of running, music and the liberal arts, published outside the discipline. Findings: Auto-ethnographic studies influenced by phenomenology show that embodied information is central to the hobby of running, both through the diverse sensory information the runner uses and through the dissemination of information by the body as a sign. Studies of music drawing on the theory of embodied cognition, similarly suggest that it is a key part of amateur music information behaviour. Even when considering the liberal arts hobby, the core activity, reading, has been shown to be in significant ways embodied. The examples reveal how it is not only in more obviously embodied leisure activities such as sports, in which the body must be considered. Research limitations/implications: Embodied information refers to how the authors receive information from the senses and the way the body is a sign that can be read by others. To fully understand this, more empirical and theoretical work is needed to reconcile insights from practice theory, phenomenology, embodied cognition and sensory studies. Originality/value: The paper demonstrates how and why the body has been neglected in information behaviour research, reviews current work and identifies perspectives from other disciplines that can begin to fill the gap. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper is a partial reflection of a research in strategy development to help agriculturists in Nakhon Si Thamarat Province to increase the capacity of the community enterprises to a “good level” of performance. The purpose of this study was to examine the information behavior of farmers regarding the success of the community enterprises management in Nakhon Si Thamarat, Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research method was applied, using in-depth interviews, observation and field notes. The study area covered community enterprises located in the Muang District, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, Thailand, which were evaluated to study the levels of information behaviors. Data were collected from 45 respondents from 9 community enterprises 3 categories (passive, common, and active levels). Five interviewees were gathered in each category for the purpose of this research. Findings: The findings show the following information behaviors of farmers that support the management capacity of the community enterprises between the passive level and the active level: information needs (arising from a clear occupational purpose of an individual or a group of individuals), information-seeking (the farmers knowing and understanding the problems that require information, choosing the right information sources), searching multiple sources and selecting the right information and using this information for development and occupation. Originality/value: This research constructed a body of new knowledge of farmers’ information behaviors of community enterprises. This knowledge will lead to the development of an information behavior model for community enterprises which will help strengthen the capacity toward the active level. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Through interviews with migrants and migrant aid-workers at a shelter in the border town of Nogales, Mexico, we examine how undocumented migrants are seeking, acquiring, understanding, and using information prior to, and during, migration across the United States–Mexico border. Our study examines migrants' perceptions of humanitarian service and the use of so-called “border disturbance technologies” by activists to help prevent the death of migrants in the desert, finding that migrants appreciate water-caching efforts but generally distrust technologies they feel could subject them to surveillance by border agents. Exploratory in nature and based on a small sample, our findings are not necessarily representative of the broader population, but provide rich evidence of the prevalence of word-of-mouth information seeking and use of cell phones over other information technologies, and explore the ambivalent nature of information technology use in the vulnerable setting of life at the border. In particular, we find that mobile phones help migrants meet their communication needs, but also increase their exposure to crime and abuse. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Nomadic pastoralists, due to their lifestyle and the dominance of oral culture, have not received much attention from information service providers and little is known about their information behavior. This qualitative ethnographic study entailed twenty semi-structured interviews with Iranian Bakhtiari nomadic pastoralists using everyday life information seeking (ELIS) framework. Nomadic pastoralists' ELIS is dominated by reliance on human information sources including elders, chiefs (Khans) and family members. Most of their information needs relate to practical issues of daily life (e.g., animal husbandry, handicraft, and parenting) and therefore they prefer information sources that tap into their local and indigenous knowledge (e.g., elders) and value experience and skill over formal education when obtaining information from people. However, they purify their local knowledge through exposure to modern education. Relevance to daily life matters or practicality, previous successful utilization of information, and accessibility are among the factors they consider when choosing information sources.

AB  - This paper examines how healthy activity tracker users, particularly gym-goers, manage personal health information generated by their activity tracking devices. Findings from 117 valid responses to a web survey are presented to provide an overall picture of healthy activity tracker users' health or fitness-related needs, their personal health information management (PHIM) practices and the gaps between their needs and PHIM. Based on the survey findings, we suggest considering future activity tracker design improvements for addressing users' currently unmet needs while recognizing the limitations of current technology. We conclude with a discussion of the necessity for reexamining PHIM in a new era of broader self-tracking activities and needs. Copyright © 2017 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - Abstract: This paper proposes that to create superior information resources that meet the information needs of the target audience, a greater understanding of information processing is required. We suggest that the subjective assessment criteria that information-seekers use to process information resources and the information they contain can be used to produce design guidelines for online information resources. This is tested using data from a participant in an eighteen-month longitudinal study of expectant and new mothers. From our participant, three information resource assessment criteria (convenience, credibility, and format) and five information assessment criteria (complete, easy to understand, references, relevance and reliability) were identified. These eight criteria were used to generate design guidelines to meet the needs of our participant. This article provides an analysis tool that can be used by other researchers to collect and analyse subjective assessment criteria. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Over 90% of US hospitals provide patients with access to e-copy of their health records, but the utilization of electronic health records by the US consumers remains low. Guided by the comprehensive information-seeking model, this study used data from the National Cancer Institute’s Health Information National Trends Survey 4 (Cycle 4) and examined the factors that explain the level of electronic health record use by cancer patients. Consistent with the model, individual information-seeking factors and perceptions of security and utility were associated with the frequency of electronic health record access. Specifically, higher income, prior online information seeking, interest in accessing health information online, and normative beliefs were predictive of electronic health record access. Conversely, poorer general health status and lack of health care provider encouragement to use electronic health records were associated with lower utilization rates. The current findings provide theory-based evidence that contributes to the understanding of the explanatory factors of electronic health record use and suggest future directions for research and practice. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Many organisations are re-creating the ‘Google-like’ experience behind their firewall to exploit their information. However, surveys show dissatisfaction with enterprise search is commonplace. No prior study has investigated unsolicited user feedback from an enterprise search user interface to understand the underlying reasons for dissatisfaction. A mixed-methods longitudinal study was undertaken analysing feedback from over 1000 users and interviewing search service staff in a multinational corporation. Results show that 62% of dissatisfaction events were due to human (information and search literacy) rather than technology factors. Cognitive biases and the ‘Google Habitus’ influence expectations and information behaviour and are postulated as deep underlying generative mechanisms. The current literature focuses on ‘structure’ (technology and information quality) as the reason for enterprise search satisfaction, agency (search literacy) appears downplayed. Organisations which emphasise ‘systems thinking’ and bimodal approaches towards search strategy and information behaviour may improve capabilities. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the information behaviours of prisoners, providing insight into their information needs and information-seeking preferences, and the factors influencing their behaviours; to inform education and rehabilitation programmes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is an in-depth qualitative study. The theoretical framework was provided via Chatman’s (1996) concepts of information poverty. Participants were adult male prisoners in a Scottish maximum security prison, and prison staff. Data collection method was semi-structured interviews. Findings: Prisoners have a broad range of information needs, many sensitive and many unmet. Interpersonal information sources are predominantly used due to a combination of natural preference and restricted access to other information sources. Issues of stigma and trust influence information behaviours. Further issues include restrictive social norms, and disinformation to incite violence. A significant degree of risk is therefore inherent within interpersonal information interactions, fostering self-protective acts of secrecy and deception amongst prisoners. Unmet emotional needs appear particularly problematic. Research limitations/implications: The paper highlights the need for further research exploring issues of unmet emotional needs in prisoners; in particular, assistive methods of need recognition and support in the problematic context. Practical implications: The paper identifies significant unmet information needs in prisoners that impact upon their ability to cope with incarceration, and prepare for successful release and reintegration. Originality/value: The paper addresses an understudied group of significant societal concern and advances the understanding of information need in context, providing insight into unmet needs and issues of affect in the incarcerated small world context. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Considering the increasing penetration of Internet and mobile technologies, we can foresee that more online debates and political discussions, such as online deliberations, will occur in the future. However, prior research does not illustrate or provide empirical evidence to support steps that that online deliberation should take. To address this gap, we conduct a case study on Project ThunderGo, an online deliberation campaign related to the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Election. Via analyzing data obtained from their deliberation groups, the relevant news articles, and the election results, we establish a four-stage building, engineering, arriving, and reaching (BEAR) model of online deliberation and provide some practical implications for future deliberation host. The model and implications articulat e ICT’s role in addressing complicated and multi-facet social problems. © 2019 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to identify prominent patterns of media use across six media (e.g. television, social media, public libraries) and four gratification contexts (e.g. studying, leisure activities), and second, to investigate whether media use patterns vary with six individual characteristics by introducing the construct of information repertoire. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through an online questionnaire completed by 811 adult internet users in the USA. Latent class analysis (LCA), including latent class regression, was performed to analyse the data. Findings: The study found eight information repertoire profiles. The user characteristics associated with each profile, such as age, race and ethnicity, were identified. The profile with the most respondents was characterised by heavy use of TV and the internet for everyday leisure activities. Overall, the eight profiles do not show exclusive use of one or two media (such as a power-law pattern). However, the profiles do exhibit patterned behaviour, in which respondents use the same configuration of media in two or more gratification contexts. These findings suggest some level of gratification-based heuristic in media selection and use when respondents face contexts they deem to be similar. Originality/value: In conceptual development, the study introduced the construct of information repertoire to capture media use profiles that account for multiple media use across multiple contexts. Methodologically, less-used LCA was applied, which allowed combining the 24 variables (6 media×4 gratification contexts) and the six demographic covariates in a single, unified analysis. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Although there are a number of studies that have been carried on the motivations to use social media, little has been published about the information behaviors patterns led by motivations on different social media platforms. To fill this gap, this study is to address the paucity in research on analysis of the relationship between college students' motivations and information behaviors. Using WeChat, Weibo and QQ as the platform for our case study and based on a questionnaire survey, the differences in motivations by demographical characteristics, social media usages preferences, information behaviors led by motivations, and the correlation between the motivations and users information behaviors are examined, which is extremely valuable for researchers and educators to understand the college students psychological characteristics and behavior patterns in social media environment, and will be helpful for social media service system to understand the information needs of youth users and better serve them in different social media platforms. © 2016, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University.

AB  - This study investigated the information behaviour of rural desert women residing in Hafizwala village from the Bahawalnagar district, Pakistan. Data were collected from adult females using an interview questionnaire. Face to face interviews with each female were conducted by visiting their houses. The rural desert women required information mainly on health (self and family), child education, religion, pregnancy related issues, cattle and poultry care, water purification. They perceived political, agricultural, nutritional, housekeeping, and current affaires related information as important. These respondents relied heavily on informal information sources such as family members, close relatives, and friends in information acquisition. Inaccessibility, illiteracy, lack of awareness, poor economic conditions, cultural restrictions, and language or communication barriers were the primary barriers in acquiring everyday information. These results are useful in planning need-based information delivery system for desert communities in Pakistan as well as other developing countries in Africa and Asia. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Purpose: Serendipity is an interesting phenomenon to study in information science as it plays a fundamental – but perhaps underestimated – role in how we discover, explore, and learn in all fields of life. The purpose of this paper is to operationalize the concept of serendipity by providing terminological “building blocks” for understanding connections between environmental and personal factors in serendipitous encounters. Understanding these connections is essential when designing affordances in physical and digital environments that can facilitate serendipity. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, serendipity is defined as what happens when we, in unplanned ways, encounter resources (information, things, people, etc.) that we find interesting. In the outlined framework, serendipity is understood as an affordance, i.e., a usage potential when environmental and personal factors correspond with each other. The framework introduces three key affordances for facilitating serendipity: diversifiability, traversability, and sensoriability, covering capacities of physical and digital environments to be diversified, traversed, and sensed. The framework is structured around couplings between the three key affordances and three key personal serendipity factors: curiosity, mobility, and sensitivity. Ten sub-affordances for serendipity and ten coupled personal sub-factors are also briefly outlined. Related research is compared with and mapped into the framework aiming at a theoretical validation. The affordance approach to serendipity is discussed, including different degrees and types of serendipity. Findings: All the terminological “building blocks” in the framework are seen to resonate with the included related research. Serendipity is found to be a commonplace phenomenon in everyday life. It is argued that we cannot “engineer” nor “design” serendipity per se, but can design affordances for serendipity. Serendipity may thus be intended by designers, but must always be unplanned by users. The outlined affordance approach to serendipity points to the importance of our sensory-motor abilities to discover and explore serendipitous affordances. Research limitations/implications: Implications of the framework for designing physical and digital environments with affordances for serendipity are briefly considered. It is suggested that physical environments may have a primacy regarding affordances of sensoriability for facilitating serendipity, and digital environments a primacy regarding traversability, whereas physical and digital environments may afford similar degrees of diversifiability. In future research, the framework needs further empirical validation in physical and digital environments. Originality/value: No other research has been found addressing affordances for serendipity and connections between environmental and personal factors in similarly detailed ways. The outlined framework and typology may function as a baseline for further serendipity studies. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: The internet is an emerging source of information for prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Since little is known about the quality of information on PCa provided online, we investigated its accordance to the latest European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines. Methods: A total of 89 German web pages were included for analysis. A quality model classifying the provider of information and its expertise was introduced. Correctness of provided information was systematically compared to the EAU guidelines. Results: Information was provided by medical experts (41%), media (11%), and pharmaceutical companies (6%). Certificates were found in 23% with a significantly higher rate if provided by medical experts (p = 0.003). The minority of web pages showed information in accordance with the EAU guidelines regarding screening (63%), diagnosis (32%), classification (39%), therapy (36%), complications (8%), and follow-up (27%). Web pages by medical experts as well as websites with any kind of certification showed a significantly higher guideline conformity regarding diagnosis (p = 0.027, p = 0.002), therapy (p = 0.010, p = 0.011), follow-up (p = 0.005, p < 0.001), and availability of references (p = 0.017, p = 0.003). Conclusions: The present study reveals that online health information on PCa lacks concordance to current guidelines. Certified websites or websites provided by medical experts showed a significantly higher quality and accordance with guidelines. © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate and model the process of organizing personal information in digital form in the context of everyday life. Design/methodology/approach: A background survey, a diary study and two interviews were conducted with each of the 18 participants, who are information users in social science academic environments. In particular, the personal information organization process (PIOP) model was developed by tracking and analyzing 143 organization events. Findings: The PIOP model consists of six stages: initiation, identification, temporary categorization, examination/comparison, selection/modification/creation and categorization. This model also shows actions, thoughts and decisions involved in the organization process, and 19 factors that impact the process. Originality/value: This study introduces a new model that specifically shows the process of organizing personal information. This study advances our understanding of the process and informs the design and development of systems and applications that support personal information management. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper traces the historical developments using selected literature related to 'library anxiety', 'information seeking anxiety' and 'information anxiety'. These concepts existed independently and parallelly and attracted much attention from the researchers of their respective fields. The existing literature lacked a study establishing a relationship among these three concepts which led to the idea of a general model of information anxiety to inform researchers as well as professionals dealing with policy and practice. This model represents information anxiety as the general and broader concept nesting information seeking anxiety as its sub-set and library anxiety as a further sub-set. It highlights the development of library anxiety, information seeking anxiety, and information anxiety over time. It also outlines the theoretical and practical implications of information anxiety for information services, especially information literacy (IL) instruction, as previous research reported it as a potential determinant of lower levels of information anxiety. The researchers emphasize the necessity for a need-based IL curriculum for the alleviation of users' anxiety related to information related tasks. The future directions for research on the proposed area considering the contemporary information environment have been discussed towards the end. © 2019 Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - Purpose-This paper aims to investigate the effect of cancer patients' information behaviour on their decision-making at the diagnosis and treatment stages of their cancer journey. Patients' information sources and their decision-making approaches were analyzed. Design/methodology/approach-Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 participants. Findings-The cancer patients sought information from various sources in choosing a hospital, physician, treatment method, diet and alternative therapy. Physicians were the primary information source. The patients' approaches to treatment decision-making were diverse. An informed approach was adopted by nine patients, a paternalistic approach by four and a shared decision-making approach by only two. Practical implications-In practice, the findings may assist hospitals and medical professionals in fostering pertinent interactions with patients. Originality/value-The findings can enhance researcher understanding regarding the effect of cancer patients' information behaviour on their decision-making. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Today, more and more people migrate to different parts of the world. Previous studies showed that these newcomers use various online and social sources to acquire information in new countries, but a few recent studies have indicated that “wandering” is a type of information behavior that newcomers use to become familiar with their new environments. This paper extends our knowledge of wandering behavior by examining international newcomer students' wandering and information acquisition based on findings from a study of international students' information behavior. Also, we add to the existing literature on information behavior (IB) models and theoretical concepts by analyzing wandering through the lenses of Wilson's information behavior model and Erdelez's concept of information encountering.

AB  - This article provides the first empirical study focused exclusively on the information intermediary role in disadvantaged (socioeconomic) and dependent (support) circumstances. We report findings from interviews and focus groups with 49 UK state and voluntary sector professionals providing support to young (<21) mothers from areas of multiple deprivations. We evidence an important information intermediary role with three key contributions to information behaviors in disadvantaged and dependent circumstances. Intermediaries: facilitate information needs recognition, and consider purposeful action within problematic situations; are a key source of information in themselves, and a key integrative connection to other external sources not otherwise accessed; and tailor and personalize information for relevance, and communicate via incremental and recursive cycles that take into account learning needs. We provide parameters for a theory of information intermediary intervention to guide future examination of an important and understudied role; and conceptualize important theoretical relationships between information behavior and social capital, and in particular shared concepts of social integration, and the progressive and integrative intermediary role within. Our findings have significant practical implications for public health policy and digital health strategies, as they evidence an important human information intermediary role among an at-risk group, with implications for disadvantaged and vulnerable populations more broadly. © 2018 ASIS&T

AB  - Reviews related empirical and theoretical literature on the information behaviour of students living with visual impairments in university libraries. The literature reviewed show that students living with visual impairments in University libraries need information for writing assignments, tests, examinations, research and more like their counterparts without visual impairments. In addition, the sources of information preferred by students living with visual impairments include library staff, classmates, friends, readers employed by disability units to assist them to read, OPAC and databases. Furthermore, their preferred sources of information should be appropriately packaged in print and electronic formats. The literature further reveals that assistive technologies can effectively be used to facilitate access to information by students living with visual impairments in University libraries. It was revealed that shortage of information resources in Braille and large print, inaccessible library buildings and lack of assistive technologies are the major challenges affecting access to and use of information by students living with visual impairments. Therefore necessary policy and practical interventions where they do not exist should be promulgated so that assistive technologies, infrastructure (e.g. building layout) and resources are made available to alleviate these challenges facing students living with visual impairments in the universities. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose. Within the field of information science, adolescent information behaviour as a part of the general decision making process is a relatively under-examined area. The way adolescents interact with information when making decisions influences decision outcomes and consequently affects their lives. Therefore, the study of information be-haviour in the decision making process is an important area for research development. The goal of this paper is to take a step to advance research in this direction by reviewing what has been learnt and offering directions for future work. Methodology. The existing publications reporting the research on adolescent information behaviour related to making everyday life decisions within the information science field were investigated using content analysis methodology. Twenty articles were selected and analysed in the following aspects: information behaviour, including information seeking, passive information acquisition and information avoidance, information sources, barriers to information seeking, information use and affective experiences. Findings. It was found that the research on the topic of decision making within the information science field is scarce. Few studies focus specifically on adolescent information behaviour for making everyday life decisions and they consider only one specific decision situation. The existing work reveals that adolescents employ a wide range of information behaviour when making decisions in everyday life, both active and passive: information seeking, passive information acquisition which encompasses passive search and passive attention, community approach, deferring information seeking and information avoidance. They use a variety of information sources, and source selection depends on internal and external factors. They face barriers which impede information seeking and use information to increase knowledge on decision situations and therefore help the decision making process. Adolescent information behaviour in this context proved to be accompanied with affective experiences. Limitations. Some limitations of the study refer to the coverage of the literature from the information science field, to the selection of the relevant literature and to summarizing of the findings given the limitations of the form, i.e. a single chapter. Originality. This study tackles one of the barely touched areas in information science and youth information behaviour research and raises some important questions which need to be addressed. © VBH 2018.

AB  - This article outlines a constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014) study of information poverty among a group of mothers of individuals with Down syndrome and/or Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from a critical perspective, drawing on concepts from critical disability theory, critical race theory, and critical work within information and library science. The researchers gathered interview data from 24 mothers. Resulting data were inductively analyzed using Chatman's (1996) theory of information poverty. We propose information marginalization as a complimentary concept to describe the contextual conditions that contribute to a range of defensive information behaviors and suggest that assessment of these contextual conditions be a part of the system design process. This study has implications for the development and design of systems and service models intended to provide access to information and services for individuals with disability and contributes to a critical literature on information poverty. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - Purpose: Although the impacts of trust on information disclosure have been well recognized, the trust building mechanisms in social media are still underexplored. To fill this gap, the purpose of this paper is to explore two trust building mechanisms, namely, institution-based and transference-based trust building and identify how these two mechanisms vary across gender. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted to collect data. The partial least squares method was used to examine the relationships among regulatory effectiveness, three trusting perceptions and disclosure intention. A cross-group path coefficient comparison method was used to test gender differences. Findings: The results suggest that regulatory effectiveness affects competence- and character-based trust and these impacts are stronger for males than for females. Both competence- and character-based trust influence general trust in members while their impacts vary. Competence-based trust is more important for males while character-based trust is more important for females. Originality/value: This study contributes to social media literature by identifying the two trust building mechanisms with special attention to the role of regulatory effectiveness and trust transfer. Further, this study also sheds light on how these two mechanisms vary across gender. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article presents a segment of the results gathered in a doctoral study that investigated information needs and behavior of Catholic priests in Croatia. The study focused on parish priests in particular and their information needs and behavior in the liturgy and care-giving role. The research was conducted with the help of quantitative and qualitative methodology. Print questionnaires were filled out by 327 respondents, while in the follow-up interviews 20 respondents took part. Research results show that respondents, in the care-giving role and liturgy, require information about theology, general culture, psychology, and pedagogy. More than half of respondents find information for liturgy on religious websites and in their personal parish libraries. However, in their care-giving role they seek information most often from their parishers, members in parish pastoral and economic boards, and from colleagues at their regular meetings organized by the (arch)diocese. Both in liturgy and care-giving role, respondents use religious publications to a much larger degree than secular books, magazines, or newspapers. The respondents explained that in liturgy they consult colleagues and parishers in order to exchange advices and ideas, while in the care-giving role some respondents also prefer to seek an advice from an expert in specific field. The results of this study can help Catholic Church and theological faculties when preparing the information literacy courses for future parish priests. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © 2018, © Darko Lacović and Sanjica Faletar.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the information needs and barriers of rural smallholder farmers in Mzimba North in Malawi. A mixed methods approach was adopted for the study and the Wilson’s Model of Information Behaviour (1996) guided the study. A questionnaire and focus group discussion guide were used to collect data from 202 rural smallholder farmers. The study found that the major information need of rural smallholder farmers was crop husbandry as revealed by the majority of rural smallholder farmers 149 (77.6). The study found that majority of rural smallholder farmers 180 (94.8%) were aware of information sources. The study also found that the predominant information sources consulted by rural smallholder farmers were personal experiences as indicated by the majority of rural smallholder farmers 185 (96%). The major challenge faced by rural smallholder farmers was lack of mobility as revealed by the majority of rural smallholder farmers 147 (76.6). The study recommends that the Department of Agriculture Extension Services (DAES) should empower the social structures such as families in rural settings with agricultural information. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evidence and better understand adolescent information behaviours in disadvantaged and disengaged circumstances, and explore issues of social integration. Design/methodology/approach – Interdisciplinary theoretical framework bringing together theories of information behaviour with theories of social capital. Mixed method design incorporating observation, interviews, and focus group conducted in areas of multiple deprivations. Participants’ young people aged 16-19 not in education, employment or training (NEET); and their support workers. Findings – Heightened access and internalised behavioural barriers found beyond those common to the general adolescent population, the former influenced by technology and literacy issues, the latter by social structures and norms. There is evidence suggestive of deception, risk-taking, secrecy, and situational relevance in information behaviours, and a reliance on bonding social capital characteristically exclusive and inward facing. Low levels of literacy and self-efficacy are significant interrelated issues, with NEET youth dependent upon support workers when seeking and processing information, and demonstrating passive non-motivated information behaviours often abandoned. Research limitations/implications – Highlights the need for further interdisciplinary research to explore complex relations between social and affective factors, and that seeks to both understand and influence information behaviours in disadvantaged and disengaged circumstances. Practical implications – Remedial literacy education recommended as an immediate priority for public and third sector agencies. Originality/value – First study of adolescent information behaviours in disadvantaged and disengaged circumstances. Novel interdisciplinary theoretical framework evidences and draws attention to understudied and enduring information poverty issues of significant societal concern, potentially consigning a significant proportion of the youth population to a stratified existence within an impoverished (small) information world. Sets a focused interdisciplinary research agenda. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This research examines the information seeking and use behaviour of Filipino domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore, who collectively make up around 40% of about 173,000 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in this city state. It is based on the premise that low-paid migrants are generally typecast as ‘information poor’, who are left with very common, limiting, and homogeneous information sources. The FDWs are drawn to their co-equals to form an information ground where they can exchange information serendipitously. A survey questionnaire was administered to 138 FDWs to learn about their information behaviour and problems encountered during information seeking. A 5-day ethnographic study in their off-work context supplemented the quantitative data. The study found that FDWs inadequately meet the requisites for digital and information literacy, which are indispensable yet lacking among many low-skilled migrants. Implications about public governance, education, and the pedagogical component of technology use through streamlined information dissemination are discussed to benefit these FDWs. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand the information security behaviour of the students of the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh in the use of smartphones. Bangladesh is well-known as one of the largest and fastest growing mobile phone market of the world, and the University of Dhaka is also the largest student’s assembly in the country in terms of using smartphones. Besides, the rising use of smartphones is also likely to be typical of other sub-continent countries. Design/methodology/approach: To gain an understanding of the information security behaviours of the students of University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, a quantitative survey method was deployed in revealing the approaches of the students towards avoidance of various security risks. A total of 356 students participated in the study, although eight of the participants did not carry out the full survey because they do not use smartphones. The collected data were analysed with suitable statistical methods. Findings: The findings of the study reveal that students of University of Dhaka possess a moderately secure behaviour in terms of avoiding harmful behaviours, using useful phone settings and add-on utilities and disaster recovery. This study also shows that the students do not behave securely in all aspects of using different security features in the same way, and it also varies somewhat according to gender, and between faculties and institutions. The university library is recommended as the focus for instruction and guidance on the best practice in smartphone use by students. Research limitations/implications: The study does not include any other universities of Bangladesh except University of Dhaka due to the shortage of time. A further study can be conducted to gain an understanding in a greater extent by including students of the other universities and perhaps also other countries. Originality/value: This is the first paper in Bangladesh related to the study of information security behaviour regarding the use of smartphone among the student of University of Dhaka. This study will help to raise information security awareness among the students and encourage the authorities to adopt appropriate strategies and policies to resolve information security risks in the use of smartphones. Specially, the university library can take some initiatives in this case, such as providing advice, seminars, workshops and lectures to make the students aware about security issues. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report the design and implementation of the enhanced participant-driven photo elicitation method in a qualitative interview study, to assess the performance of the method to investigate a research topic in everyday life health information behaviour and to provide insights on how to effectively use this method in future research. Design/methodology/approach: The author embedded the enhanced participant-driven photo elicitation in a qualitative interview study to examine people’s everyday life health information behaviour with activity tracking technology. The author assessed the types of visual data collected by the method, categories of elicitation enabled by the method and how the method contributed to key research findings of the interview study. Findings: The enhanced participant-driven photo elicitation generated rich, unique and meaningful data that would be otherwise difficult to collect through conventional qualitative interviews. The method also elicited explanation, rationalisation and reflection during the interviews, which enriched and triangulated key research findings. This work validated the benefits of the general photo elicitation method such as aiding participants’ recall of experiences, enriching research findings and improving research validity. It also demonstrated that the enhancement techniques used in this study could generate rich and even research data across interviews. Originality/value: This paper describes the design and implementation of the enhanced participant-driven photo elicitation method to augment a qualitative interview study with activity tracker users. The author provides recommendations for researchers to take full advantage of the method in future everyday life health information behaviour research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a study that explored human behaviour in response to political “facts” presented online by political parties in Scotland. Design/methodology/approach: The study consisted of interactive online interviews with 23 citizens in North-East Scotland, in the run-up to the 2017 UK General Election. Findings: Participants demonstrated cognitive and critical responses to facts but little affective reaction. They judged facts swiftly and largely intuitively, providing evidence that facts are frequently consumed, accepted or rejected without further verification processes. Users demonstrated varying levels of engagement with the information they consume, and subject knowledge may influence the extent to which respondents trust facts, in previously unanticipated ways. Users tended to notice facts with which they disagreed and, in terms of prominence, particularly noted and responded to facts which painted extremely negative or positive pictures. Most acknowledged limitations in capacity to interrogate facts, but some were delusionally confident. Originality/value: Relatively little empirical research has been conducted exploring the perceived credibility of political or government information online. It is believed that this and a companion study are the first to have specifically investigated the Scottish political arena. This paper presents a new, exploratory fact interrogation model, alongside an expanded information quality awareness model. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In this paper, we present the results of a user study on exploratory search activities in a social science digital library. We conducted a user study with 32 participants with a social sciences background—16 postdoctoral researchers and 16 students—who were asked to solve a task on searching related work to a given topic. The exploratory search task was performed in a 10-min time slot. The use of certain search activities is measured and compared to gaze data recorded with an eye tracking device. We use a novel tree graph representation to visualise the users’ search patterns and introduce a way to combine multiple search session trees. The tree graph representation is capable of creating one single tree for multiple users and identifying common search patterns. In addition, the information behaviour of students and postdoctoral researchers is being compared. The results show that search activities on the stratagem level are frequently utilised by both user groups. The most heavily used search activities were keyword search, followed by browsing through references and citations, and author searching. The eye tracking results showed an intense examination of documents metadata, especially on the level of citations and references. When comparing the group of students and postdoctoral researchers, we found significant differences regarding gaze data on the area of the journal name of the seed document. In general, we found a tendency of the postdoctoral researchers to examine the metadata records more intensively with regard to dwell time and the number of fixations. By creating combined session trees and deriving subtrees from those, we were able to identify common patterns like economic (explorative) and exhaustive (navigational) behaviour. Our results show that participants utilised multiple search strategies starting from the seed document, which means that they examined different paths to find related publications. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Workplace learning and employee-led innovation are related. For example, mistakes made when learning may spur innovation. Investigated in this paper is the role of information literacy in the learning of innovative work behaviour in the workplace, and the associated information behaviours that allow for innovative work behaviour to develop. Thus, interactions between people, information and innovation are a main focus. The findings derive from analysis of data generated in twelve semi-structured interviews conducted within a Finnish organisation. Employee perceptions on the role of information in the workplace, and its role in supporting the learning of innovative work behaviour, are explored. The analysis reveals that: (1) information literacy skills serve as a prerequisite for workplace learning; (2) information behaviours support the learning of innovative work behaviour and; (3) a variety of information sources support employees as they learn to behave innovatively.

AB  - Purpose: Transitions – as a focus of study – have been missing from information behaviour research. The purpose of this paper is to explore the topic of transitions – their characteristics and influences, the related concept of liminality and Transitions Theory – and what it can contribute to the field of information behaviour. This exploration includes the application of liminality and Transitions Theory to an empirical study of participants making the transition from doctoral student to early career academic. Design/methodology/approach: In addition to an extended literature review, this paper reports on a qualitative study that used constructivist grounded theory methodology for data collection and analysis. Early career academics were followed for a five- to seven-month period and data were collected using interviews and “check-ins”. Transitions Theory and liminality were used to guide the analysis. Findings: Three important findings were highlighted: the complicating effects of being in a liminal space on information behaviour; the changing information needs of those undergoing a transition; and the importance of comparison as a way of using information to understand new situations. A revised model of Transitions Theory (Meleis et al., 2000) is also proposed, to incorporate information behaviour. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates that by examining information behaviour over longer periods of time and by making transitions a focus of research, new understandings and insight can be gained into what information individual needs, how they find, share and use that information. This research demonstrates that information behaviour research adds important elements to the study of transitions and, conversely, that transitions (and Transitions Theory) add important elements to the study of information behaviour. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Although people disclose illicit activities such as drug use online, we currently know little about what information people choose to disclose and share or whether there are differences in behavior depending on the illicit activity being disclosed. This exploratory mixed-methods study examines how people discuss and disclose the use of two different drugs—marijuana and opioids—on Reddit. In this study, hermeneutic content analysis is employed to describe the type of comments people make in forums dedicated to discussions about illicit drugs. With inductive analysis, seven categories of comments were identified: disclosure, instruction and advice, culture, community norms, moralizing, legality, and banter. Our subsequent quantitative analysis indicates that although the amounts of disclosure are similar in each subreddit, there are more instances of instruction and advice in discussions about opiates, and more examples of banter in comments about marijuana use. In fact, both subreddits have high rates of banter. We argue that banter fosters disclosure in both subreddits, and that banter and disclosure are linked with information-seeking behaviors in online forums. This work has implications for future explorations of disclosure online and for public health interventions aimed at disseminating credible information about drug use to at-risk individuals. © 2017 ASIS&T

AB  - Purpose: Understanding the customers’ habits of getting cosmetic products information is of great importance to enhance the effectiveness of advertising and marketing strategy of cosmetics. In China, as females are the major target customers of cosmetics, this paper aims to analyze the information behaviors of obtaining cosmetics information of different women groups, including the preferences of information channels and the corresponding means of getting information. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on a questionnaire survey. A total of 419 effective questionnaires were collected from females who had bought cosmetics in China. Descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis were used to analyze the data. Findings: According to the result of the questionnaire survey, women preferred to get information through social platforms and physical stores. And the primary reason of the choice was that they believed the information from the channel they chose was reliable. The survey also revealed that age, educational level and occupation would significantly affect their preferences of information channels. Originality/value: There was no previous research which analyzed Chinese women consumers’ information-seeking behaviors about cosmetic products information as well as the influence factors of the behaviors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article describes the first two parts of a three-stage study investigating the information behaviour of fans and fan communities, focusing on fans of cult media. A literature analysis shows that information practices are an inherent and major part of fan activities, and that fans are practitioners of new forms of information consumption and production, showing sophisticated activities of information organisation and dissemination. A subsequent Delphi study, taking the novel form of a 'serious leisure' Delphi, in which the participants are not experts in the usual sense, identifies three aspects of fan information behaviour of particular interest beyond the fan context: information gatekeeping; classifying and tagging; and entrepreneurship and economic activity. © Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals.

AB  - Purpose: Social question and answer (social Q&A) sites have become a popular tool for obtaining music information. The purpose of this paper is to investigate what users ask about, what experience the questions convey, and how users specify their questions. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 3,897 music questions from the social Q&A site Yahoo! Answers were categorized according to their question type, user experience, and question specification. Findings: The music questions were diverse with (dis)approval (42 percent), factual (21 percent), and advice (15 percent) questions as the most frequent types. Advice questions were the longest and roughly twice as long as (dis)approval and factual questions. The user experience associated with the questions was most often pragmatic (24 percent) or senso-emotional (12 percent). Pragmatic questions were typically about the user’s own performance of music, while senso-emotional questions were about finding music for listening. Notably, half of the questions did not convey information about the user experience but the absence of such information did not reduce the number of answers. In specifying the questions, the most frequent information was about the music context and the user context. Research limitations/implications: This study suggests a division of labor between social Q&A sites and search engines for music information retrieval. It should be noted that the study is restricted to one social Q&A site. Originality/value: Social Q&A sites provide an opportunity for studying what information real users seek about music and what information they specify to retrieve it, thereby elucidating the role of social Q&A in music information seeking. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Knowledge and proper understanding of the needs, expectations, desires, demands, values or preferences of Generation X and Millennials is an essential goal of any company. The mission of marketers is increasingly diffi cult because they have to develop a marketing mix able to target effi ciently all customers, invoking satisfaction and loyal behavior. Communication strategy therefore has a special role to play. While Millennials are easier to target, persuade even infl uence through social media, Gen Xers are more conservative, preferring to look for additional information about products and companies themselves, which makes the marketer’s job even more diffi cult. Nowadays, social media plays an increasingly important part in infl uencing consumers and their consumption behavior. Being able to expand beyond geographical borders, social media creates strong links between consumers in different states and social environments. Research conducted among Gen Xers and Millennials shows that whenever they choose food products and tourist services based on recommendations and the information available on social media, their purchasing behavior depends on their own personal desire to become informed, and the characteristics they expect from a piece of information and from the Internet as a general source of information. Given this, companies changed and adapted their communication strategies in order to be more present online. In addition, for those interested, companies create offi cial pages that can represent a strong support for those interested in acquiring information. Quite often, consumers have the possibility to compare goods and services before buying, minimizing the risks attached to these acquisitions. The results reveal that Millennials have stronger affi nity with, and place greater reliance upon online information than Gen Xers. From a managerial perspective, this paper provides retailers with the opportunity to better understand the behavior of customers of different ages, making their targeting more successful. © 2018, Technical University of Liberec.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the role of emotional aspects in information retrieval of PhD students from the web. Design/methodology/approach: From the methodological perspective, the present study is experimental and the type of study is practical. The study population is PhD students of various fields of science. The study sample consists of 50 students as selected by the stratified purposive sampling method. The information aggregation is performed by observing the records of user’s facial expressions, log file by Morae software, as well as pre-search and post-search questionnaire. The data analysis is performed by canonical correlation analysis. Findings: The findings showed that there was a significant relationship between emotional expressions and searchers’ individual characteristics. Searchers satisfaction of results, frequency internet search, experience of search, interest in the search task and familiarity with similar searches were correlated with the increased happy emotion. The examination of user’s emotions during searching performance showed that users with happiness emotion dedicated much time in searching and viewing of search solutions. More internet addresses with more queries were used by happy participants; on the other hand, users with anger and disgust emotions had the lowest attempt in search performance to complete search process. Practical implications: The results imply that the information retrieval systems in the web should identify emotional expressions in a set of perceiving signs in human interaction with computer, similarity, face emotional states, searching and information retrieval from the web. Originality/value: The results explicit in the automatic identification of users’ emotional expressions can enter new dimensions into their moderator and information retrieval systems on the web and can pave the way of design of emotional information retrieval systems for the successful retrieval of users of the network. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Effective treatment and management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depend on patients’ ability to locate, comprehend, and apply health information. This study’s purpose was to identify characteristics associated with these skills among HIV positive adults in the Dominican Republic. An information behavior survey was administered to 107 participants then three logistic regressions were conducted to identify characteristics associated with information seeking, processing, and use. Never having cared for someone who was sick was significantly associated with less information seeking, processing, and use. Males were more likely to be active information seekers and those who had attended the clinic for six or fewer years were less likely to actively seek information. Younger individuals had increased odds of higher information processing and those without comorbidities had increased odds of more information use. Results may inform researchers, organizations, and providers about how patients interact with health information in limited resource settings. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to argue that scholars in the information behavior (IB) field should embrace the theoretical framework of the everyday to explore a more holistic view of IB. Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes the theory of the everyday and delineates four opportunities offered by scholars of the everyday. The paper concludes with three examples that highlight what a more everyday-focused everyday information behavior might look like. Findings: The theory of the everyday provides a useful theoretical framework to ground research addressing the everyday world as well as useful concepts for analysis and research methodology. Originality/value: The theoretical framework of the everyday contributes to IB research by providing a theoretical justification for work addressing everyday life as well as useful concepts for analysis. The paper also outlines the benefits of integrating methods influenced by institutional ethnography, a methodology previously used to address the nuances of the everyday world. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Information need is one of the core concepts in library and information science, yet the concept is still not well understood. Nor is there clear agreement on how information needs should be measured. Understanding this concept is crucial for a discipline like library and information science, which is highly focused on meeting users’ information needs. This review of the literature highlights the lack of clarity in conceptualising information need. It also explores the measurement of information need. Literature pertaining to terminological debates, contextualisation of information needs, theoretical frameworks, research methods, survey instruments and longitudinal reviews of the research on information needs informs this review. The evaluation of selected literature shows that there are terminological issues associated with defining information need; lack of theoretical foundations underpinning empirical research; and use of weak proxies, such as information seeking behaviour and information use, in the measurement of information need. © 2017 Australian Library & Information Association.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to historicise research conducted in the fields of Information Seeking and Learning and Information Literacy and thereby begin to outline a description of the history of information in the context of Swedish compulsory education. Design/methodology/approach: Document work and documentary practices are used as alternatives to concepts such as information seeking or information behaviour. Four empirical examples of document work – more specifically informational reading – recorded in Swedish primary classrooms in the 1960s are presented. Findings: In the recordings, the reading style students use is similar to informational reading in contemporary educational settings: it is fragmentary, facts-oriented, and procedure-oriented. The practice of finding correct answers, rather than analysing and discussing the contents of a text seems to continue from lessons organised around print textbooks in the 1960s to the inquiry-based and digital teaching of today. Originality/value: The paper seeks to analyse document work and documentary practices by regarding “information” as a discursive construction in a particular era with material consequences in particular contexts, rather than as a theoretical and analytical concept. It also problematises the notion that new digital technologies for producing, organising, finding, using, and disseminating documents have drastically changed people’s behaviours and practices in educational and other contexts. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objectives: Researchers have discussed that journalistic reporting of medical developments is often characterised by exaggeration or lack of context, but additional quantitative evidence to support this claim is needed. This study introduces a quantitative approach to assessing coverage of medical innovations, by aiming at provided references to observed clinical effects. Although observed clinical effects reflect increased chances for future medical applications, it is unknown to which extent newspaper articles refer to it when spreading health information. We aimed to assess, over a 6-year period, newspaper publication characteristics of diabetes innovations, arising from all scientific areas of interest, regarding the total count and the proportion of articles that provide references to demonstrated clinical efficacy. Study design: Quantitative content analysis of newspaper articles covering innovative treatments for diabetes. Methods: We performed a systematic review of newspaper articles between 2011 and 2016 printed in the largest six Dutch newspapers. By assessing in-article references, it was possible to quickly distinguish between (1) articles that referred to actual clinical efficacy demonstrated in a scientific setting and (2) articles that presented either predictions, fundamental research, preclinical research or personal experiences and recommendations. Proportion differences between scientific areas of interest were analysed using the chi-squared test. Results: A total of 613 articles were categorised. Total newspaper publication frequency increased with 9.9 articles per year (P =.031). In total, 17% of the articles contained a reference to any proven clinical efficacy. Articles about human nutrition science (7%; P =.001) and (neuro)psychology (4.3%; P =.014) less frequently provided a reference to actual clinical efficacy. Conclusions: Our findings show that less than one in five newspaper articles about diabetes research contains a reference to relevant clinical effects, while the publication count is increasing. These statistics may contribute to feelings of false hope and confusion in patients. © 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - The school library is a place for students to find information. Due to the various information provided inside, students have many choices in finding the information they need. Therefore, school libraries should have a strategy to maximize their services. This study aims to determine the motivation of high school students in Surabaya in utilizing their school library. The method used is descriptive quantitative approach. The sample of this research is high school students in Surabaya selected using multistage random sampling with a total of 200 respondents. The data were collected through questionnaires. The results of this study indicates that the main motivation of high school students in Surabaya in using school libraries is the comfortable space, invitations from friends, completing schoolwork, love for reading, recommendations from teachers, prestige, and spare time. Based on these findings, the school library can provide services that go in accordance with the expectations of the users. © 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - Workplace knowledge sharing is a complex process and there are a large number of studies in the area. In this article three theoretical approaches in library and information science are used to discuss knowledge sharing in the workplace. The approaches are information behavior, social capital, and information culture, and they bring important insights that need to be considered from a holistic management point of view when it comes to knowledge sharing. The individual's relation to different levels of context is important, meaning both in relation to work roles, work tasks, situations, organizational structures, and culture. The frameworks also shed light on where and how knowledge sharing activities are present in the organization. From a knowledge management point of view, it is important to acknowledge that when knowledge is valued, there is also an awareness of the knowledge sharing activities. Also, in addition to more traditional views of context, the frameworks bring forward different views on context, such as time and space as contextual factors. © Gunilla Widén 2017.

AB  - Information behavior may enhance hypertension self-management in African Americans. The goal of this substudy was to examine the relationships between measures of self-reported health information behavior and neural measures of health information processing in a sample of 19 prehypertensive African Americans (mean age = 52.5, 52.6% women). We measured (a) health information seeking, sharing, and use (surveys) and (b) neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess response to health information videos. We hypothesized that differential activation (comparison of analytic vs. empathic brain activity when watching a specific type of video) would indicate better function in three, distinct cognitive domains: (a) Analytic Network, (b) Default Mode Network (DMN), and (c) ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Scores on the information sharing measure (but not seeking or use) were positively associated with differential activation in the vmPFC (rs =.53, p =.02) and the DMN (rs =.43, p =.06). Our findings correspond with previous work indicating that activation of the DMN and vmPFC is associated with sharing information to persuade others and with behavior change. Although health information is commonly conveyed as detached and analytic in nature, our findings suggest that neural processing of socially and emotionally salient health information is more closely associated with health information sharing. © 2018 ASIS&T

AB  - Humanities research informs people's movements across time and reshapes cultural worldviews. While we know that humanists integrate information resources into their research program and that serendipitous discoveries enable truly transformative knowledge creation, our picture of discovery in the humanities is unclear. There is an important role for information professionals to better support humanistic discovery as routine practice. To fully comprehend the complex research activities of humanities scholars it is necessary to expand upon existing models of information encountering (IE) by analyzing discovery episodes and the temporal and topical factors in play. We take particular interest in studying how scholars in the art history and archeology disciplines conceptualize, pursue, and often complete research projects. Ultimately we present an amended IE model that reveals intricate connections between IE, rediscovery, and altruistic collaboration mutually evolving over distinct timespans.

AB  - Insider threat is a “wicked” contemporary organizational problem. It poses significant threats to organizational operations and information security. This article reviews insider threat research and outlines key propositions to conceptualize the interpretation of dynamic human information behavior in an organizational setting, which represent an integration of trustworthiness and human sensors’ attribution in close relationships. These propositions posit that when a focal individual violates integrity-based trust, the group can collectively attribute a shift in trustworthiness, triggering a natural peer attribution process that assigns cause to observed behavior. Group communication can thus reflect subtle changes in a focal individual’s perceived trustworthiness. The ability to understand group-based computer-mediated communication patterns over time may become essential in safeguarding information assets and the “digital well-being” of today’s organizations. This article contributes a novel theoretical lens to examine dynamic insights on insider threat detection. © 2017 ASIS&T.

AB  - The effects of distraction on completion scores generate a gap that is generally not taken into account in information behavior studies. This research investigated what happens if researchers de facto allow distractions to occur in a test situation. It examined the type and magnitude of occurred distractions, the effects distractions have on completion scores, and whether different distractions affect different test activities differently. In the research design, participants were randomly assigned to either a controlled environment or their natural environment. The results showed that whereas participants in the natural environment needed more time to complete the post task questionnaire than their laboratory counterparts, they spent a similar amount of time on the tasks. Participants were capable of, and indeed willing to, limit the less-urgent distractions in the interests of getting the tasks done. If they were interrupted by a human contact, however, the completion time for tasks increased significantly. Previous studies showed that distractions change information behavior. Yet, the present results provide evidence that these changes do not always occur, and thus there needs to be a better demarcation of the limits within which distraction can be expected to change how people interact with information. © 2015 ASIS&T

AB  - Understanding the information-seeking preferences and Internet access habits of the target audiences for a patient portal is essential for successful uptake. The resource must deliver culturally and educationally appropriate information via technology that is accessible to the intended users and be designed to meet their needs and preferences. Providers must consider multiple perspectives when launching a portal and make any needed adjustments once the launch is underway. We report results of a study of 270 parents and caregivers of paediatric patients in a major health system during the process of implementing a patient portal. Through a 26-question paper-and-pencil survey, data were collected on participant demographics, Internet access and use, health information–seeking behaviours, health literacy, and potential use of a patient portal. Results indicate a positive attitude towards portal use but also suggest that low health literacy may be a key issue to portal adoption. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the “race report” as a document genre in the serious-leisure pursuit of ultrarunning. Despite the sport’s largely non-documental nature, race reports stand as an anomaly in their importance. This exploration serves as a springboard to investigate the informativeness of story in human life generally. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative survey of the information behavior of ultrarunners was conducted. The 46 participants were runners in a 100-mile footrace in 2016. Responses were first analyzed through phenomenological theme analysis and then were subjected to a deductive audit using a framework of information activities validated for use in serious-leisure pursuits. Findings: Race reports are bound up in information activities across the information-communication chain. Race reports help athletes choose races, prepare for races, pre-experience races, communicate their race experiences, gather new ideas, extend their training and, finally, find entertainment. Research limitations/implications: This discussion of genre is synchronic, largely limited to one moment in time, and its findings were limited in depth by the survey method. Further research should investigate race reports historically (diachronically) and infrastructurally. Originality/value: This work points to symbiosis between genre theory and information behavior theory. It also legitimizes narrative reasoning as a way of knowing, which has been largely unrecognized in information behavior. Some implications of this for information science and technology are discussed. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Information science research has begun to broaden its traditional focus on information seeking to cover other modes of acquiring information. The purpose of this paper is to move forward on this trajectory and to present a framework for explicating how in addition to being sought, existing information are made useful and taken into use. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual enquiry draws on an empirical vignette based on an observation study of an archaeological teaching excavation. The conceptual perspective builds on Andersen’s genre approach and Huvila’s notion of situational appropriation. Findings: This paper suggests that information becomes appropriable, and appropriated (i.e. taken into use), when informational and social genres intertwine with each other. This happens in a continuous process of (re)appropriation of information where existing information scaffolds new information and the on-going process of appropriation. Originality/value: The approach is proposed as a potentially powerful conceptualisation for explicating information interactions when existing information is taken into use rather than sought that have received little attention in traditional models and theories of human information behaviour. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The study investigated the information behavior of students towards the use of library information resources in Universities in Oyo State, Nigeria. The study adapted the Wilson's model of Information Behavior and adopted a correlational survey research design. A sample size of four hundred respondents was drawn from selected universities in South Western Nigeria, using a simple random sampling technique. Regression analysis and correlation analysis were used to analysis data obtained from the field. The findings of this study revealed that among the information behavior independent variables which include information needs, seeking and sources, only information needs significantly influence information use. However, information needs, seeking and sources do have a significant joint effect on students' information use. Also, information accessibility was found to have significant controlling effect on the relationship between information availability and use which makes information availability and accessibility very useful variables in the information behavior study especially as regards to students as conceptualized in the academic community in this study. The study recommends that academic library should endeavour to embark on users' needs assessment from time to time to be able to make available needed information resources that would meet users' needs and also enhance use of information available. © 2018 Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore young people’s conceptions of political information. The study sought to identify what political information sources young people encounter, how they construe these sources and the messages they communicate, and how the information experiences of young people may be better understood to inform information literacy interventions to support the development of political agency. Design/methodology/approach: Using personal construct theory as a conceptual framework, repertory grid (RG) interviews were used to explore the different ways in which 23 young people aged 14-15 from a town in Northern England conceive of political information and how they evaluate its quality and authority. Findings: The study identified the sources of information young people engage with for finding and receiving what they understand as political information. The results from the RG interviews indicated that young people use a wide range of sources of political information to become informed about politics and the world around them. These sources of information include family, friends, teachers, television news, newspapers, radio shows, comedy shows, social media and community meetings. Participants were aware that they passively encounter information sources as well as actively engage in debate and discussion with other sources. Some participants had difficulty critically evaluating the political information sources they encounter. The nature of young people’s experiences of political information varied greatly. The degree of complexity in the experiences of political information varied not only between participants but was also dependent on their particular relationship with the information sources under scrutiny. Research limitations/implications: The paper has implications for personal construct analysis as a research approach broadly, from the point of view of its use within library and information science research. It is the first study to apply the personal construct approach to the study of young people’s political information use and to consider implications for information literacy support that would have been difficult to access using other approaches. Practical implications: The paper provides insight into an understudied area; that of young people’s conceptions of political information. This insight may be used to inform the improvement of political information provision and information literacy support for young people. Social implications: A deeper understanding of the different ways in which young people identify, engage with and use information for political purposes may contribute to a clearer understanding of young people’s information needs, ideally leading to improved political education and a strengthened democratic process. Originality/value: The paper explores a relatively under-researched area of library and information science research, and does so using a relatively under-used method in the domain. Insights into the perceived characteristics of different sources of political information are novel and contribute to the development of information behaviour and information literacy fields in terms of information for empowerment and democracy. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study aims to identify different styles of personal digital information categorization based on the mindscape of the categorizers. To collect data, a questionnaire, a diary study, and 2 semistructured interviews were conducted with each of 18 participants. Then a content analysis was used to analyze the data. Based on the analysis of the data, this study identified 3 different types of categorizers: (i) rigid categorizers, (ii) fuzzy categorizers, and (iii) flexible categorizers. This study provides a unique way to understand personal information categorization by showing how it reflects the mindscapes of the categorizers. In particular, this study explains why people organize their personal information differently and have different tendencies in developing and maintaining their organizational structures. The findings provide insights on different ways of categorizing personal information and deepen our knowledge of categorization, personal information management, and information behavior. In practice, understanding different types of personal digital information categorization can make contributions to the development of systems, tools, and applications that support effective personal digital information categorization. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore how both producers and consumers of user-created music videos on YouTube communicate emotional information. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 150 filmic documents containing fan-generated versions of U2’s “Song for Someone” were purposively collected. The author used discourse analysis to understand the types of videos created, the communication of emotional information from both the producers and the consumers, the social construction of emotion in the filmic documents, and elements of intertextuality that represented emotion. Findings – Fans created videos containing cover versions, original versions of the song with new visual content, and tutorials about how to play the song. Producers of cover versions communicated emotional information, especially tenderness, through facial expression, their surroundings, and corresponding musical elements. Producers’ visual content expressed emotion through meaningful photographs and sad stories. Producers’ descriptions revealed emotion as well. Emotions were individually experienced and socially constructed. Consumers conveyed emotion through likes, dislikes, and expressive positive comments. Intertextuality communicated passion for U2 through tour references, paraphernalia displays, band photographs, imitating the band, and musical mashups. Practical implications – Information science can work towards a new generation of multimedia information retrieval systems that incorporate emotion in order to help users discover documents in meaningful ways that move beyond keyword and bibliographic searches. Originality/value – This is one of the earliest research papers in the area of emotional information retrieval (EmIR). © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: A new approach to investigate serendipitous knowledge discovery (SKD) of health information is developed and tested to evaluate the information flow-serendipitous knowledge discovery (IF-SKD) model. The purpose of this paper is to determine the degree to which IF-SKD reflects physicians’ information behaviour in a clinical setting and explore how the information system, Spark, designed to support physicians’ SKD, meets its goals. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed pre-experimental study design employs an adapted version of the McCay-Peet’s (2013) and McCay-Peet et al.’s (2015) serendipitous digital environment (SDE) questionnaire research tool to address the complexity associated with defining the way in which SKD is understood and applied in system design. To test the IF-SKD model, the new data analysis approach combining confirmatory factor analysis, data imputation and Monte Carlo simulations was developed. Findings: The piloting of the proposed novel analysis approach demonstrated that small sample information behaviour survey data can be meaningfully examined using a confirmatory factor analysis technique. Research limitations/implications: This method allows to improve the reliability in measuring SKD and the generalisability of findings. Originality/value: This paper makes an original contribution to developing and refining methods and tools of research into information-system-supported serendipitous discovery of information by health providers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Due to the existence of certain laws and connections in a large number of disorderly and complex data, the data mining is to find out valuable information behavior from the huge amount of data. An important part of the teaching management is the evaluation of the teaching level of the teachers. How to evaluate the degree of the teachers' teaching level is to find the regularity and relation among them in the large amount of teaching data. Based on the research of data mining algorithm, Apriori algorithm was studied and improved. The improved algorithm was Apriori-B algorithm. Apriori-B algorithm was used to mine the data of teaching system, so as to evaluate the teaching level of colleges and universities.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the different search behaviors exhibited by participants while performing learning-oriented search tasks. The search tasks have been designed to represent the cognitive levels of learning hierarchically. We investigate how the searcher's behavior and perceived learning outcomes vary with increasing levels of cognitive complexity. In this study, we analyze the search log data of the participants, self-reports, questionnaires and interviews both descriptively and statistically. Our results suggest that the perceived topic knowledge of the participants, perceived interest and difficulty assessments increase with increasing levels of the task. We use this study to discuss the preliminary results and highlight the limitations and future directions of this study. Copyright © 2017 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - This paper presents an information needs matrix as a navigation guide for refugees and host societies to support integration. It is an outcome from an information behaviour investigation into refugee integration, conducted through interviews with asylum seekers and refugees. A sense-making methodology was used as a framework to examine the experiences of refugees, focusing on the situations and information gaps encountered during integration. The study identified information needs on housing, financial, legal and social support, mobility, health, education, employment and state benefits. A unique feature of the proposed matrix is the order dependency of the uncovered needs by our investigation. The findings were validated with observation data collected while undertaking a role at the Scottish Refugee Council. The matrix can be used to guide society's provisions for integration, assess levels of individual integration and inform the design of information support for refugees. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As newcomers, international students face information challenges in unfamiliar environments. Studies have reported that social and online resources, such as friends and the Internet, are their important sources of information, but research is less clear about how international students seek information through social sources. This paper examines social information practices of new international students in a U.S. university during adjustment to their new local environments. Also, based on prior studies, we investigate how international students' socio-national context, specifically the degree to which there are co-nationals in one's local environments, shapes their social information practices. Findings show that international students from common countries of origin (China, India, and Korea) developed online and mobile communities with co-national students and shared local information among them while most international students from other less common countries did not engage in such co-national networking and information practices. This paper suggests that information behavior theories account for people's socio-national contexts to better inform research and practice involving internationally mobile individuals and groups.

AB  - Background: Pregnant women are at risk of oral health problems. This qualitative study aims to understand dental care-seeking behaviours of pregnant women and their oral health-related information acquisition, to identify barriers to and motivators for, dental visits, and further explore their expectations and possible strategies to improve oral health care during pregnancy. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 pregnant women (after 32 gestational weeks) enrolled in the antenatal care programme in a public hospital in Hong Kong. Two main areas of interest were probed: Dental care-seeking behaviour and oral health information acquisition. Their expectations and suggestions on oral health care service for pregnant women were also explored. An inductive thematic approach was adopted to analyse the data. Results: Pregnant women’s dental care-seeking behaviour was deterred by some internal factors, such as misunderstandings on oral health, and priority on other issues over oral health. External factors such as inconvenient access to dental service during pregnancy also affected their care-seeking behaviours. Oral health information was passively absorbed by pregnant women through mass media and the social environment, which sometimes led to confusion. Oral health information acquisition from antenatal institutions and care providers was rare. Greater attention was paid to dental visit when they obtained proper information from previous dental visit experience or family members. A potential strategy to improve oral health care suggested by the interviewees is to develop a health care system strengthened by inter-professional (antenatal-dental) collaboration. Efficient oral health information delivery, convenient access to dental service, and improved ‘quality’ of dental care targeting the needs of pregnant women were identified as possible approaches to improve dental care for this population. Conclusion: Dental care-seeking behaviour during pregnancy was altered by various internal and external factors. A lack of, or conflict between, information sources result in confusion that can restrict utilisation of dental service. Integrating dental care into antenatal service would be a viable way to improve dental service utilisation. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigates children’s information search behaviour to learn about their search characteristics. The study uses a qualitative approach by observing and noting children’s searching process. A total of 30 children aged 7-9 years participated in this study. The unobtrusive observation of children’s searching process via the Web were recorded using Camtasia software. Probing interviews were used to gather understanding on how the children perceive information trustworthiness. The data was analysed using a thematic coding approach. The findings highlighted two main characteristics of children’s search: Credible Searcher and Convenience Searcher. The children in general could gauge information trustworthiness and have confidence with regard to the relevance, reliability and the credibility of resources. The children do not consider source reputation and currency as an important criterion when seeking information. This study contributes to a better understanding of information trustworthiness as reflected in young children’s information seeking and processing. © 2019, University of the Punjab.

AB  - This study investigates how contextual factors such as culture, geographical location and religious status may either encourage, determine or prevent information seeking behavior. The study applied both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection as a mixed-method. Fifteen Catholic clergymen from Northern Nigeria were interviewed and 109 participated in a survey. Findings show that geographical location, culture, and religious status may influence these clergy's information seeking behavior. This paper contributes to research on information seeking in context. It may help in understanding the effects of some contextual factors, especially religious status, on information seeking behavior and, consequently, aid in the planning of library and information systems that meet the needs of the African clergy and theological institutions.

AB  - This study identified the influence of the main concepts contained in Zipf's classic 1949 book entitled Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort (HBPLE) on library and information science (LIS) research. The study analyzed LIS articles published between 1949 and 2013 that cited HBPLE. The results showed that HBPLE has a growing influence on LIS research. Of the 17 cited concepts that were identified, the concept of “Zipf's law” was cited most (64.8%), followed by “the principle of least effort” (24.5%). Although the concept of “the principle of least effort,” the focus of HBPLE, was not most frequently observed, an increasing trend was evident regarding the influence of this concept. The concept of “the principle of least effort” has been cited mainly by researchers of information behavior and served to support the citing authors’ claims. By contrast, the concept of “Zipf's law” received the most attention from bibliometrics research and was used mainly for comparisons with other informetrics laws or research results. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article shows that citizens consider policy positions for the formation of their political preferences when they actively seek and find high-quality information, while they dismiss passively acquired and low-quality information. The study develops an extended theory of information and political preferences that incorporates the process of information acquisition and its connection with information quality. A novel experimental design separates the effects on political preferences due to information behavior as an activity from those due to selective exposure to information. The study applies this design in a laboratory experiment with a diverse group of participants using the example of issue voting and European integration in the context of the 2014 European Parliament elections. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - This study investigated the psychometric properties of Information Seeking Anxiety Scale (ISAS) using postgraduate students in a Pakistani university. A 47-item ISAS was administered to 297 students, selected through stratified convenient sampling procedure, by visiting each department at the university. An eighty-five percent response rate was achieved through usable returned questionnaires. The principal component analysis (PCA) using varimax rotation yielded six-factor solution to the Information Seeking Anxiety Scale (ISAS), namely, (1) Resource Anxiety; (2) ICT Anxiety; (3) Library Anxiety; (4) Search Anxiety; (5) Mechanical Anxiety; and, (6) Thematic Anxiety. This six factors corresponded to those of Erfanmanesh, Abrizah, and Karim (2012) but differed somewhat with regard to the statements loaded on each factor. Moreover, these six-factors combined together accounted for 52.7 percent of the total variance explained. Seven item were dropped as a result of reliability analysis resulting 40-item instrument. Also, the values of Cronbach's internal reliability coefficient alpha for overall ISAS and its sub-scales were found satisfactory as recommended by Nunnally and Bernstein (1994). These results demonstrated the psychometric soundness and stability of ISAS when tested with Pakistani postgraduate students recruited from a research-intensive university. More psychometric studies are required before drawing any sound conclusions regarding adequacy of ISAS in assessing information seeking anxiety in Pakistani information users.

AB  - Until present, little attention has been given in the study of heritage crafters’ information behavior. In Malaysia, none of the user studies have been conducted in the last decade focusing solely on songket weavers. This paper provides the results of a study involving in-depth interviews with nine weavers. This study is an attempt to explain how the weavers search for information, the access tools they use, and the barriers they face. The findings informed the information seeking, selecting, organizing and maintaining in the process of weaving the songket. The findings of this study can be used to develop a proper songket design data repository systems that will facilitate access for this significant group of crafters or weavers. © 2019 SERSC.

AB  - While there has been increasing interest in how creative professionals find information to drive creative outputs, previous information behavior research has largely ignored how arts and crafts hobbyists look for information sources in their everyday lives. To fill this literature gap, we conducted interviews and observations with arts and crafts hobbyists to find out how they conceive potential DIY projects. The findings highlight three themes: the dearth of human sources, the prevalence of domain-specific information, and the use of self-curated information. In addition to empirical results, this work also broadens the understanding of information behavior in an arts and crafts context by studying populations beyond professional artists.

AB  - New developments in digital technology and better and affordable access allow women unprecedented access to information and communication networks - if they are able to use digital technologies to access networks and digital information. This study presents a case study of motivations of women to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in a ubiquitous information environment. This study follows an interpretive paradigm to explore an understanding of culture and gender in a middle-class Indian context. Women in this report varied in terms of heavy/light and mandatory/voluntary use. We discuss the implications of such variations in terms of technology adoption for digital inclusion. Social factors, such as the role of parents and social communities, were found to influence women to develop and maintain interests in ICT that were reflected in their professional and personal lives. Some women were slow to adapt to ICT use as they tended to adhere to normative expectations which hindered ICT use. Women tend to have greater ICT use if it is for fulfilling familial roles and for communication. © First Monday, 1995-2018.

AB  - Emerging pandemics call for unique health communication and education strategies in which public health agencies need to satisfy the public’s information needs about possible risks while preventing risk exaggeration and dramatization. As a route to providing a framework for understanding public information behaviors in response to an emerging pandemic, this study examined the characteristics of communicative behaviors of social media audiences in response to Ebola outbreak news. Grounded in the social amplification of risks framework, this study adds to an understanding of information behaviors of online audiences by showing empirical differences in audience engagement with online health information. The data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Facebook channel. The final data set included 809 CDC posts and 35,916 audience comments. The analysis identified the differences in audience information behaviors in response to an emerging pandemic, Ebola, and health promotion posts. While the CDC had fewer posts on Ebola than health promotion topics, the former received more attention from active page users. Furthermore, audience members who actively engaged with Ebola news had a small overlap with those who engaged with non-Ebola information during the same period. Overall, this study demonstrated that information behavior and audience engagement is topic dependent. Furthermore, audiences who commented on news about an emerging pandemic were homogenous and varied in their degree of information amplification. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Public Health Education.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to advance our understanding of the challenges of health information literacy (IL) education in disadvantaged and disengaged at-risk populations; and from the perspective of professionals out with information professions occupying everyday support roles. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative in-depth case study. The participants were a team of UK Family Nurses providing outreach support to young expectant mothers from areas of multiple deprivations, and the mothers themselves. The data collection methods were observation, survey, interviews and focus groups. Findings: Information needs of mothers are multiple, and not always recognised as information problems, or revealed. Several felt overwhelmed, and actively avoided health information. There is low awareness and/or use of state sources of online health information. Family nurses provide an important information intermediary role, but are unfamiliar with IL concepts and models; consequently, there is limited evidence of client transitions to independent information seeking, or underpinning pedagogical practices to achieve such goals. Research limitations/implications: Further research is required into appropriate pedagogical approaches to IL education adaptable to semi-structured everyday situations. Recognition of information need requires particular attention, including methods of elicitation and specification in the problematic context. Practical implications: In an era of digital transitions and public service reforms, the authors raise important questions regarding the true reach of public health policy. Originality/value: The paper holistically examines nurse–client information behaviours, and extends the discussion of low IL in nurses beyond issues of evidence-based practice to issues of developing healthcare self-efficacy in at-risk clients. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Every year the library of IIUM subscribes to quite a number of online databases with huge expenses but the utilization of these databases is countable. 10 out of 53 subscriptions have been terminated by 2015 to save the cost go in vain. The purpose of this paper is to develop a model based on the ISB elements to identify the reason behind this low usage and to increase the usage of online databases in the future. It has undertaken a quantitative approach to identify the elements of ISB among undergraduate (UG) students. The primary data has been collected through questionnaires based on the variables identified in the objective. There are 118 samples participating in this research and the proposed model has been adapted from Savolainen and Wilson. Psychological perception, searching strategies and the information resources have been considered as the independent variable and measured the usage of the online database among UG students as the dependent variable. The results have shown that there are seven elements which have an influence on the usage of the online database among IIUM UG students. Despite the limited number of samples and a specific group of students, the proposed model can enhance the usage of online database system subscribed to by IIUM library and a search engine can be developed to get the usage increased. In that sense, it is recommended to involve more participants from the different levels of students and users to get diverse elements of ISB. However, the paper contributes to bridging the gap between the online database usage and the users, believed to have an effective outcome for online database subscription. It is hoped that the proposed model would significantly fill this gap and help the library to increase the number of users for their expensive databases. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - The ubiquitous nature of the Internet provides an ideal platform for human communication, trade, information sharing and learning. Websites play a central role in these activities as they often act as a key point of interaction for individuals in navigating through cyberspace. In this article, we look beyond the visual interface of websites to consider exactly what occurs when a webpage is visited. In particular, we focus on the various web scripts that are often programmatically executed, to explore the extent to which third-party sites are referenced. Our aim is to study these references and the ecosystem that they create. To gain maximal impact while also allowing for a cross-country comparison, our study is scoped to an assessment of the top 250 sites in the UK, USA, Germany, Russia and Japan. From our analysis, there are various novel contributions of note. These include the empirical identification of a vast ecosystem of third-party information processing sites, especially advertisement networks, and the evidential discovery of a few significant players irrespective of country and locale. Through a user study, we also find that while individuals do have some knowledge of the prevalence of advertisements in websites, their understanding of the variety of activities that occur upon visiting websites, is not widely known. Going forward, we therefore advocate for increased transparency in such activities and the wider online advertisement ecosystem. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to determine factors that influence people living with HIV (PLHIV) to engage in internet-based HIV information seeking behaviour in selected Tanzanian public regional hospitals. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a questionnaire-based survey to 221 PLHIV in two regional public hospitals in Mwanza and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. They assessed the validity and reliability of the measurement model by using exploratory factor analysis and also used hierarchical regressions to examine the research hypotheses by using Statistical Package for Social Science. Findings: The study found that there is low usage of internet (24.3 per cent) to search online HIV information. Factors related to attitude and information source accessibility predicted usage intentions of internet, while facilitating conditions, information source accessibility and usage intention of internet determined actual use of internet among PLHIV. Age moderated the effects of information source quality and social influence on usage intention of internet, and the effects of the information source accessibility and social influence on actual use of internet. The findings imply that younger PLHIV were more likely to use internet to access HIV information than the older respondents due to perceived ease of accessing information and quality of the online content. Further, older PLHIV were more influenced by the views of others when making decisions to use internet. Practical implications: Health-care providers and libraries need to conduct regular studies on health needs of patients, and promote benefits of accessing online information; website designers need to design user-friendly databases; public libraries need to include a section on health information; hospital and public librarians need to provide catalogues of health information resources on their websites; and health-care providers need to improve technological infrastructure. Originality/value: This is a comprehensive study that provides empirical findings to better understand the HIV information seeking behaviour from actual internet users, particularly factors that may influence PLHIV to seek online information in Tanzania. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe the pattern of everyday life information needs of a group of people in an area with limited access to information, and to investigate how the major dimensions of the everyday life information seeking (ELIS) model apply to information needs in the contexts of the Catholic clergy. Design/methodology/approach – The study applied the concurrent triangulation strategy of mixed-methods research. Data from 15 episodic interviews and surveys of 109 Catholic clergy in Northern Nigeria were collected and analyzed. Findings – A map of the everyday life information needs was developed. Three types of everyday life information needs were identified: essential needs; circumstantial needs; and occasional needs. The information needs of these clergy did not fit into the two major dimensions of Savolainen’s ELIS model. Research limitations/implications – The study was conducted only with Catholic clergy serving in the Northern Catholic dioceses of Nigeria. Originality/value – Although the ELIS model has been applied in several studies, not much attention has been given to comparing how the major dimensions of the model apply to information needs of a group of people in a variety of contexts. This study contributes to the ELIS model by pointing to other contextual situations where seeking orienting and practical information may not be sufficient to account for the everyday life information needs of some types of users. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction: Clinical specialists need to develop necessary information skills to meet their research requirements. The current study focused on the effect of educational interventions by clinical informationists on medical students’ information behavior. Methods: This was a semi-experimental study in which a two group pretest–posttest design was used. The population consisted of 60 medical students (30 in the experimental and 30 in the control group at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences) who were selected through the convenience time based sequential sampling method. A researcher-made questionnaire including 19 items based on a 5-point Likert scale (very little to very high) was used to collect data which were then analyzed by SPSS using the descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The trainings offered by the clinical informationists motivated the experimental group to focus on seeking information about clinical issues. Following the intervention, the experimental group achieved significantly higher need to search for information, during and after clinical rounds, than the control group. Moreover, the use of electronic information resources and clinical databases in the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group. Conclusions: Considering the importance of electronic information resources, universities of medical sciences are required to teach the use of databases, specifically as part of the medical students' curriculums and medical education programs. © 2019, Journal of Health Administration.

AB  - Purpose: Altmetric indicators have been proposed as a complement to citation counts in research evaluation. Conceivably, they might also be used to supplement other methods for estimating journal readership. The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of Mendeley reference management software to characterize the features of the readership of library and information science (LIS) literature. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the Social Sciences Citation Index to retrieve 54,655 articles and reviews published between 1995 and 2014 and indexed in the category “Information Science & Library Science”. Each record was then searched in Mendeley to obtain the number of bookmarks of the paper and the academic status of the users. Findings: Mendeley covers 61 per cent of the LIS literature published in the last 20 years. In all, 75 per cent of the papers published in the last five years had been bookmarked at least once in Mendeley whereas just 55 per cent had been cited in Web of Science. Reviews are bookmarked more frequently than articles, and papers in English have more bookmarks than papers in any other language. Most users of LIS literature are PhD and postgraduate students. Originality/value: The study shows that altmetrics can be used as a source of data in information behaviour studies. Reference management software provides an unobtrusive means of capturing reading habits in the scholarly literature. Compared to citation counts, bookmarks are rapidly available and also reflect usage outside the academic community. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Information world mapping (IWM) is a participatory, arts-based elicitation method for use in interviews about information behaviours or practices. The participant-drawn maps that result from this technique are typically used as ancillary data sources to aid in analysis of interview transcripts; however it may be possible, and even useful, to analyze these maps as data independent of the interviews, using methods suited to image analysis. This brief paper and accompanying visual presenta- tion describe results of analyses of information world maps using four different and contrasting methods with accompanying examples, and issue recommendations regarding the use of qualitative content analysis, compositional analysis, conceptual analysis, and visual discourse analysis, for analysis of information world maps. These insights may be generalized to other objects (e.g., photos) created through arts-based elicitation interviewing. Copyright © 2018 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - It is challenging for master's students, as novice researchers, to gather information throughout the process of thesis topic development. Information world mapping (IWM) provides a framework to depict a wide range of information activities and practices as well as the items, places, and relationships involved in a specific context from individuals' perspectives. The current study used IWM visual elicitation interviews to conduct a longitudinal study with 14 master's students at three iSchools. Since students typically develop their thesis topics throughout the first year in the master's program, each student was asked to draw an IWM during the interview after the first and second semesters ended. Situational analysis and qualitative content analysis were used to analyze the data.

AB  - Collaborative research teams working in developing countries rely on information and computer technologies (ICTs), both hardware and software, to overcome barriers to information sharing including, language, distance, time, economic development and politics. However, studies have shown impediments to information sharing between team members from different cultures, nations and institutions. This paper reports on a study in which a model was developed to highlight the most important barriers for communication and information sharing in international research teams, which was the basis for the development of a heuristic evaluation tool. The communication model was created using the results of 30 semi-structured interviews with agricultural scientists working in international research teams based in Australia and Lao People's Democratic Republic. Interview data outline a number of barriers and facilitators for team communication, which informed the development of eight intercultural heuristics. These were combined with Jakob Nielsen's general usability heuristics to form the intercultural heuristic evaluation tool, or I-CHET. The tool was then tested in a pilot study to assess the utility and usability of two ICTs used by international research teams: email and Skype. The initial assessment using I-CHET showed that while email theoretically lacked the richness of cues seen in Skype, email better complied with the needs of international research groups for sharing information and communicating in multicultural teams dispersed over language, cultural and geographic divides.

AB  - In collaboration with a public library system, faculty from a health sciences center library offered a series of courses for older adults based on the NIHSeniorHealth Toolkit for Trainers. A mixed-methods survey was offered to all program attendees during the training sessions. The survey assessed participants’ perceived eHealth literacy, which websites they searched for eHealth information, participants’ most/least trusted sources of health information, and if/what barriers exist for older adults when searching for eHealth information. Results from this pilot program indicate that participants believe access to eHealth resources is important and useful, but are unsure what online resources are available, how to find them, or how to evaluate their quality. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Tara Malone, Phill Jo, and Shari Clifton.

AB  - Inquiry project-based learning is a contemporary focus area in curriculum development around the world. This new learning approach requires students to locate appropriate information from various sources in order to satisfy their information needs under strict anti-plagiarism requirements. However, technological advancement inadvertently allows convenient plagiarism opportunities. Students must learn how to enhance their academic integrity and not to copy information directly from readily available sources like the Internet. This study investigated junior secondary students’ standard of academic integrity. Data was collected through information literacy tests, plagiarism checks on student group projects and structured interviews. Poor information literacy and language abilities were found to be potential factors behind poor academic practice, and academic integrity teaching proved to be largely effective. Therefore, related teaching should be further included in the school curriculum starting at the junior secondary level. Including a statement of academic honesty as part of school policy could also heighten students’ awareness of academic integrity and bring about plagiarism-free learning to actualize genuine education. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Healthcare assistants’ decision-making during direct care is clearly influenced by how information is assessed and used. Healthcare assistants work in a variety of environments with varying degrees of supervision. While there exists a body of literature on information behaviours for registered nurses there is little literature that focuses on healthcare assistants who are a growing population of unregistered supportive staff commonly under the supervision of registered nurses. A greater understanding of the information behaviours used by healthcare assistants is needed to support registered nurses who delegate direct care to healthcare assistants. The aim of the review is to use the existing research literature to identify information behaviours utilised by healthcare assistants. An extensive review of domestic and international literature focused on paid caregivers and their information behaviours was conducted using the search engines Medline via Ovid, CINAHL Complete, PubMed and PsycINFO from 1980 to April 2016. The search strategy produced 17 papers. Four social contexts were represented within the literature: home health care; residential dementia care; nursing homes; and acute hospital environments. The literature was organized using typologies common to information behaviour theory and research: sense making; information as a process; information as knowledge; and information as a commodity. This review highlights the influence that situational factors and social contexts have on information behaviours and the need for research that can explicate that relationship. © 2018, Nursing Praxis in New Zealand.

AB  - Purpose: Web search is more and more moving into mobile contexts. However, screen size of mobile devices is limited and search engine result pages face a trade-off between offering informative snippets and optimal use of space. One factor clearly influencing this trade-off is snippet length. The purpose of this paper is to find out what snippet size to use in mobile web search. Design/methodology/approach: For this purpose, an eye-tracking experiment was conducted showing participants search interfaces with snippets of one, three or five lines on a mobile device to analyze 17 dependent variables. In total, 31 participants took part in the study. Each of the participants solved informational and navigational tasks. Findings: Results indicate a strong influence of page fold on scrolling behavior and attention distribution across search results. Regardless of query type, short snippets seem to provide too little information about the result, so that search performance and subjective measures are negatively affected. Long snippets of five lines lead to better performance than medium snippets for navigational queries, but to worse performance for informational queries. Originality/value: Although space in mobile search is limited, this study shows that longer snippets improve usability and user experience. It further emphasizes that page fold plays a stronger role in mobile than in desktop search for attention distribution. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Research into the public's motivations for, and barriers to, the use of referendum campaign sites was carried out in the final weeks before the 2014 vote on Scottish independence. As a qualitative study, drawing on 54 interactive, electronically-assisted interviews, where participants were observed and questioned as they searched for and used information on the websites and social media sites of the campaign groups, the results enable more precise causal inferences to be drawn about voters’ exposure to campaign sites. Results indicate participants value ‘facts’, what they perceive as authoritative voices, the capacity to compare campaign messages directly, infographics and concise, direct information. They are sceptical, particularly about celebrity contributions, preferring expert messages, and uncertain about their personal capacity to evaluate information they will use to make decisions. The authors set out a new model of levels of user engagement with political discourse during campaigns. Results have relevance for governments, as well as researchers in the fields of politics, communications and information management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Reading habit is an essential and important aspect for crating the literate society in this world. It shapes the personality of an individual and it helps them to develop the proper thinking methods and creating new ideas.One of the main functions of library system at college level is to inculcate the reading habits among the students. Today's students are the future citizens and also the nation builders of tomorrow. In present scenario, due to the influence of the social media and digital environment, students do not show much interest in reading the books, magazines and journals etc. The current study was carried out to investigate the disparity and dynamics of Reading Habits and Attitudes, also influence of social media on Reading Habits among the students of GDC (Boys) and GDC (Women). Based on the sample of 300 students, it was found that significant differences exist between the two groups of students in terms of types of reading material and reading resources used. Differences in reading habits and attitudes were also observed between male and female participants. The results clearly show that there is much disparity in reading habits and attitudes between the two genders. Social media and other digital media have greatly impacted the reading habits and Behaviour across the genders also. © 2019 Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - Purpose - School library plays an important role in meeting the information needs of students. Students of Senior High School require information to support their personal, study, and environmental needs. Therefore, to meet their needs, high school students conduct information seeking. This study aims to determine the information seeking behavior of high school students in Surabaya. Design/methodology/approach - The method applied in this study is a descriptive quantitative approach. The samples of this study were high school students in Surabaya- East Java-Indonesia, selected by using multistage random sampling. The data collection was conducted through questionnaires. The sample size is 200 people. Findings - The results of this study indicate that the students' major need of information relates to entertainment and following educations after graduating from high schools. The majority of high school students perform passive attention through magazines, passive search related to hobbies mostly done through magazines, active search by considering the accuracy as the criteria in choosing information sources, and continuous search through friends as a channel of information exchange. Research limitations/implications: - Practical implications - - Originality/value - Based on these results, libraries at school should provide sources of information which suits with the students' needs, where magazines mainly support their needs, peers have important role on information sharing, and school libraries, specifically librarians and teachers, must be more proactive on asking their students to take benefit from libraries at schools. © 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - Purpose – This study aims to investigate how the transition from print to electronic scholarly communication has affected faculty’s information behaviour and their perception of academic libraries. Design/methodology/approach – An online survey was distributed among academics affiliated to the member universities of the Consortium of University Services of Catalonia. A total of 2,230 replies were received. Findings – Journal articles are the most relevant information resource used for research and teaching purposes. Databases are the preferred starting point for bibliographic searches, although a significant proportion of scholars rely on Internet search engines. The main source for gaining access to documents is libraries, followed by free materials available online. Scholarly journals are the preferred channel for disseminating research outputs, with the open access being a factor of marginal interest when deciding where to publish. Originality/value – The results of this study should be useful to guide policies regarding scientific information and research and, more specifically, policies regarding academic libraries. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The literature from some selected developing countries has demonstrated that rural smallholder farmers need various information sources in pursuit of their goals of increasing production and improving their living standards. According to the sampled studies, the majority of smallholder farmers access information on crop production. Smallholder farmers are aware of information sources despite challenges faced in accessing and using information. The majority of smallholder farmers access information through personal experiences, family members and friends. Despite access to various information sources, the literature has shown that smallholder farmers face various challenges in accessing and using information sources. The major challenges reported by the literature are lack of mobility, lack of finances, lack of rural information centres, and lack of visits by extension officers. The review has highlighted the lack of literature on the information behaviour of smallholder farmers in Malawi despite the fact that the country is an agricultural economy. The review is adapted from the Masters of Library and Information Science (MLIS) thesis authored by Austine Phiri at Mzuzu University. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of information needs and information behavior of blue agave farmers in the municipality of Tequila, Jalisco (Mexico). Nowadays we can find many different kinds of agaveros —as these farmers are commonly called in Mexico— who are classified by some characteristic features, such as property holdings, economic power, social status, and others. There are two main groups of agaveros, the independent farmers and those who rent out land for others to cultivate. Findings show that the information needs of blue agave farmers and the information resources they consult are associated with their farming activities and daily lives. © 2016

AB  - Technology transfer is a vital part of knowledge creation. It is the “process of transferring scientific findings from one organization to another for the purpose of further development and commercialization” (AUTM, 2016). Technology transfer enhances society by allowing universities and national laboratories to contribute to economic development. This visual presentation presents a brief history of information science's study of technology transfer and introduces the Technology Transfer Information Intermediary (T2I2) Model. The T2I2 provides a framework for identifying and understanding information behavior related to technology transfer. The poster also includes a mechanism to dialog with the researchers.

AB  - Wine scientists and industry organisations are increasingly creating mobile web applications (apps) to support vineyard management and monitoring. While such tools are intended to improve wine industry practices, embedding user testing and user experience design in app development has not been implemented. User-focused design is essential for determining the need for new apps, for assessing the effectiveness of existing tools and to optimize usability. This poster presents the results from an exploratory, interdisciplinary study drawing on information science theory and best practices to examine vineyard managers' and grape growers' experiences with two apps: Fit Vine and VitiCanopy. This study used hands-on exploration of users' experiences with the apps in the vineyards to assess the usefulness of these tools from the users' perspective. Results include the need for consistent intuitive navigation, which is necessary to address a range of users' technological literacy levels; the need for help features to be integrated into the primary interface, which guides the users' experience; and, tools that provide added value to the work practices of users in vineyards in order to influence decision making. The results underscore the importance of involving wine industry members throughout the app- building process. Copyright © 2017 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a qualitative investigation into whether online textual postings, produced by undergraduate students as part of an undergraduate module, can demonstrate their information literacy (IL) capabilities as a discursive competence and socially enacted practice. It also asks whether these online postings embody power relations between students, tutors and librarians. Design/methodology/approach: Foucault’s notion of discursive competence and the separate but complementary concept of practice architectures (specifically focussing on “sayings”) devised by Lloyd were used as thematic lenses to categorise online discussion board postings from a formative online peer assessment exercise created for first-year UK undergraduate students. Online postings were the node of analysis used to identify patterns of language across online conversation. These postings were inductively analysed through manual content analysis. Subject’s responses were initially categorised using open coding. Findings: Postings appeared to embody student’s discursive competence and information practice in IL, especially their level of information discernment and what constituted a quality “reference” for an assignment. However, they also demonstrated that the notion of “references” (information artefacts such as a journal article) perform a certain function in reproducing the discursive practices of an academic discipline as an agreed construct between tutor, student and librarian. Practical implications: Students were engaged in the process of becoming good scholars by using appropriate online postings to create valid arguments through assessing other’s work, but what they did not do was question received meanings regarding the quality of information they used as evidence. Far from exhibiting the desired outcome of critical thinking (a cornerstone of IL) students who appeared most articulate in discussion tended to emulate the “strong discourse” put forward by their tutors and librarians. Originality/value: This research uses practice architectures and discourse analysis to analyse students’ IL capabilities and the context in which they are developed. An approach not employed hitherto. This has practical implications for the ways in which academics and librarians introduce students to the academic discourse of their discipline and the ways in which the production, communication and exchange of information in academic contexts is characterised. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Competitive intelligence failures have devastating effects in marketplaces. They are attributed to various factors but seldom explicitly to information behaviour. This paper addresses causes of competitive intelligence failures from an information behaviour lens focussing on problems with key intelligence and information needs. The exploratory study was conducted in 2016/2017. Managers (end-users) identify key intelligence needs on which information is needed, and often other staff members seek the information (proxy information seeking). The purpose of this paper is to analyse problems related to key intelligence and information needs, and make recommendations to address the problems. Design/methodology/approach: The study is placed in a post-positivism research paradigm, using qualitative and limited quantitative research approaches. In total, 15 participants (competitive intelligence professionals and educators/trainers originating from South Africa and the USA) contributed rich data through in-depth individual interviews. Findings: Problems associated with articulation of information needs (key intelligence needs is the competitive intelligence term – with a broader scope) include inadequate communication between the person in need of information and the proxy information searcher; awareness and recognition of information needs; difficulty in articulation, incomplete and partial sharing of details of needs. Research limitations/implications: Participant recruitment was difficult, representing mostly from South Africa. The findings from this exploratory study can, however, direct further studies with a very understudied group. Practical implications: However, revealed valuable findings that can guide research. Originality/value: Little has been published on competitive intelligence from an information behaviour perspective. Frameworks guiding the study (a combination of Leckie et al.’s 1996 and Wilson’s, 1981 models and a competitive intelligence life cycle), however, revealed valuable findings that can guide research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This qualitative study provides an overview of what we have learned so far about the information needs of Malaysian male juvenile offenders. This focus is important to consider when designing and delivering the best possible information services to this group. The study seeks to understand juvenile delinquents’ information needs in the prison environment, focusing on their educational needs; online information environment and with the use of electronic resources; their everyday life information seeking (ELIS) needs, in the use of personal sources and prison libraries; in the use of books and other reading materials, and for future life perspectives. Data were collected using unstructured interviews with 23 juveniles (13 to 21 years old) living in four correctional schools in Malaysia. The data analysis revealed a general theme of the purpose of information needs, the location, the information sources, preferred reading materials, preferred language and subjects read. Formal information channels such as the library may be perceived as ineffective by inmates, regardless of their types of information needs and its objective validity. The Internet and informal networks among inmates were the most preferred source of information. Delinquents in the initial stage of imprisonment had significantly greater need for information than those in the final stage. Current findings add to the limited literature the juvenile offenders’ information behavior and that of other youth. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how four international students at a Danish university cope with their study-related and everyday information needs, behaviorally as well as affectively, and how their information seeking blends with their cross-cultural adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: Each of the four participants contributed ten diaries and took part in three interviews during the first semester of their stay. Findings: International students’ information needs and seeking behavior are shaped by their host university but also by cross-cultural, personal and situational issues. While the cross-cultural issues set international students apart from domestic students, the personal and situational issues create individual differences that call for more individually tailored support. The studied international students lacked information about both study-related and everyday issues. These two types of issues were intertwined and experienced as equally stressful. However, study-related information needs were more important, whereas everyday information needs were more difficult to resolve. In addition, participants tended to feel on their own when it came to finding needed information, but studying abroad also had elements of personal growth in meeting life’s challenges. Research limitations/implications: More participants are needed to investigate how international students’ information seeking evolves over time. Originality/value: This study contributes detailed information about international students’ study-related and everyday information seeking during their first semester abroad. The study has implications for everyday-life studies of international students’ information behavior and the international classroom in general. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The authors discuss the lifeworld as a research concept for the field of information behaviour, which serves to problematise the concept of unit of analysis. In so doing, the authors demonstrate how the lifeworld can be adopted as a unit of analysis in information behaviour research, that is, how research can be based in the lifeworld rather than merely looking at the lifeworld. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first situate our discussion in the current of information behaviour scholarship. The authors then introduce the concepts of lifeworld and unit of analysis and consider how they intersect. Next, to show the importance of the lifeworld, the authors present two recent studies in which the lifeworld emerged. Finally, the authors discuss how lifeworld-based research can be conducted more conscientiously. Findings: Though many research approaches deal with lived experience in one way or another, they tend not to fully grasp these experiences. As opposed to units of analysis such as individual, social group, person-in-situation, etc., using lifeworld as a unit of analysis allows phenomena to be researched holistically and without reductionism. Research limitations/implications: The authors limit the discussion to the concept of the lifeworld as developed by Husserl, the concept’s originator. The lifeworld has been discussed and extended by other authors since, but this work is not considered here. The viewpoint is offered as a supplementary perspective, meant to be enriching to our field of study, rather than divisive. Originality/value: This is the first time the concept of the lifeworld has been fully explicated in information science. As the authors discuss, two recent information behaviour studies that “discovered” the lifeworld through their analysis. Future studies that attend to the lifeworld from the start have the capacity to build on this work and extend the horizons of information science. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Research examining the utilization of evidence-based practice (EBP) specifically among rehabilitation clinicians is limited. The objective of this study was to examine how various rehabilitative clinicians including physical therapists, occupational therapists, rehabilitation counselors, and physiatrists are gaining access to literature and whether they are able to implement the available research into practice. Methods: A total of 21 total clinicians were interviewed via telephone. Using NVivo, a qualitative analysis of the responses was performed. Results: There were similarities found with respect to the information-seeking behaviors and translation of research across the different clinician types. Lack of time was reported to be a barrier for both access to literature and implementation of research across all clinician types. The majority of clinicians who reported having difficulty with utilizing the published literature indicated that the literature was not applicable to their practice, the research was not specific enough to be put into practice, or the research found was too outdated to be relevant. In addition, having a supportive work environment aided in the search and utilization of research through providing resources central to assisting clinicians in gaining access to health information. Conclusion: Our study identified several barriers that affect EBP for rehabilitation clinicians. The findings suggest the need for researchers to ensure that their work is applicable and specific to clinical practice for implementation to occur. © 2017 Patel et al.

AB  - Although personality traits may influence information-seeking behavior, little is known about this topic. This study explored the impact of the Big Five personality traits on human online information seeking. For this purpose, it examined changes in eye-movement behavior in a sample of 75 participants (36 male and 39 female; age: 22–39 years; experience conducting online searches: 5–12 years) across three types of information-seeking tasks – factual, exploratory, and interpretive. The International Personality Item Pool Representation of the NEO PI-R™ (IPIP-NEO) was used to assess the participants’ personality profile. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to categorize participants based on their personality traits. A three cluster solution was found (cluster one consists of participants who scored high in conscientiousness; cluster two consists of participants who scored high in agreeableness; and cluster three consists of participants who scored high in extraversion). Results revealed that individuals high in conscientiousness performed fastest in most information-seeking tasks, followed by those high in agreeableness and extraversion. This study has important practical implications for intelligent human – computer interfaces, personalization, and related applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: While a substantial number of studies have examined information behaviour, most centred on choice of information source, student information behaviour, information behaviour of women, environmental uncertainty and scanning behaviour of top-level hotel executives. However, little is known about how the small and medium enterprise (SME) managers scan, seek, gather, document and use information relevant for emerging information and communication technology (EICT) adoption decision-making. This paper aims to examine the key success factors influencing SME manager’s information behaviour on EICT adoption decision-making. Design/methodology/approach: This study deploys a qualitative approach to exploring 16 key success factors shaping SME managers’ information behaviour on EICT adoption decision-making. More specifically, the study adopted both unstructured and semi-structured interviews with 20 small business managers drawn purposeful from Crunch Database. Findings: This study develops an extended technology, organisation and environment framework by incorporating the information context which helped to unravel 16 key success factors influencing small business managers’ information behaviour on EICT. From the technology context, uncertainty driven, compatibility, replacement of legacy technology, relative advantages, lack of technical know-how and perceived affordability fit for purpose influence SME managers’ information behaviour. Users’ acceptance information, efficiency driven, owner’s support shape the organisation context of perceived information need; competitor’s intelligence gathering, customer’s information gathering provider credibility and government policy influence the environmental context of perceived information need; and finally, perceived information sources credibility, herding event, testimonial and openness to other people’s ideas and experiences are shaped by the information context. Research limitations/implications: Qualitative research is normally subjective, interpretive and limited on the sample used. Because of the limited number of interviews, the generalisation of the framework and the finding is difficult. Therefore, the finding and the framework need to be established across broader population. The findings are vital considering the fact that small business managers are limited in knowledge and the study may improve the way and manner they go about seeking and gathering information relevant in adopting new ICT. Originality/value: This research provides further insight into SME managers’ information behaviour by developing a framework and identifying main factors influencing SMEs information behaviours on EICT. Therefore, understanding such factors will enrich their knowledge on some of the factors that may shape their decisions during EICT adoption decision to make effective decision. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The theory of information discernment discussed here is firmly based on models, research and scholarship of information literacy coupled with theory and research in information behaviour. This paper will explore original research conducted by Walton and Hepworth and how it has developed over the last 10 years – the pilot study was reported in the very first edition of this journal in 2007. It will show that it has led to the emergence of the concept of information discernment and how Foucault’s discourse analysis theory has been used to further critically analyse its application. This paper will show how the research has been applied in a range of contexts, from enabling students in their first year of A-level study in the UK to carry out better research for their extended project qualification (EPQ), to teaching information literacy to undergraduates in various disciplines. This research will then be synthesised to create a new theory of information discernment summarised as: the ways in which social, psychological, behavioural and information source factors influence peoples’ judgements about information. I argue that information discernment should be included in future notions of information literacy and, in particular, informs the ACRL (2016) key threshold concept that authority is constructed and contextual. Attendant psychological notions of worldview, misinformation, confirmation bias, motivated reasoning and epistemic beliefs will be explored to determine how these articulate and enrich this new theory. The paper explores how this theory can be applied in practice beyond the learning environment, and argues that, ultimately, information literacy is a subversive activity which challenges received notions of the construction, communication and exchange of information and knowledge. © 2017, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

AB  - The article reports a field study of 60 grade-eight students seeking information for their 4-month long, thesis-based class history project. The study asked: What is relevance for the group studied, and how does relevance evolve over the course of the students’ 4-month history project? Instead of investigating a unitary concept of relevance, our conceptual framework considers both topical and psychological relevance as defined by Harter (1992). The 60 student participants were divided into three groups based on their instructors’ marks. We then utilized the constant comparative method of Glaser and Strauss's grounded theory approach to code 2 class assignments that formed part of the history project. Study findings indicate that psychological relevance is constructed by the students in Associating, Translating and Verticalizing phases. Topical relevance only occurs in the Verticalizing third phase. Students in the High Mark Group indicated significantly higher instances of the Verticalizing phase than the Low and Middle Mark Groups who were stuck in the Associating and Translating phases. Students can be aided in this difficult process of constructing an effective relevance criteria framework via the design of personalized information systems that facilitate students’ involvement of their prior knowledge and belief systems in the relevance assessment process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: While there is relatively plenty of evidence for the positive impact of communication on the perceptions of organizational change, how organizational changes affect information sharing is relatively unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate if a favorable perception of ongoing organizational changes has a positive impact on information sharing and whether trust mediates this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire (n=317) was administered to the employees of a large Finnish multinational organization. Partial least square structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses based on earlier research findings. Findings: The results show that a positive perception of recent organizational changes improves information sharing both directly and indirectly, mediated by trust. Consequently, when changes are perceived negatively, employees recoil from information sharing which is known to have negative implications for organizations. Research limitations/implications: Data were collected in a single organization. The nature of the specific changes in the studied organization and its particularities undoubtedly had an effect on respondents’ perceptions. Originality/value: This paper contributes to organizational information management research by elaborating on the relationship between organizational changes and interpersonal information sharing between employees. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first quantitative study confirming the impact of the perception of organizational changes on employee information-sharing behavior. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The process of settling in a new country can be extremely challenging, entailing various information needs to cope with rapid changes and adjustments to a new environment. Through interviews with 16 Korean immigrants in the United States, we explored their information behaviors in the settlement process. In line with prior work (Shoham & Strauss, 2008), we found that Korean immigrants needed various types of information: housing, work, banking, transportation, law, school, health, and language. Out of these information types, the Korean immigrants prioritized information for education and struggled to seek health and legal information. We further uncovered that various information needs are closely intertwined and found an additional type of information need: to build a new social network after migration. They often used Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as information sources while adapting the ICT infrastructures of the U.S. into their information practices. ICTs enabled them to build and maintain “local” and “global” identity; however, they may struggle to assess user-generated content in the new context. We noted that their strong use of ICTs for intraethnic interaction might slow down their integration into the host society. We discuss implications for future work to support immigrants' settlement in the host country. © 2018 ASIS&T

AB  - In contemporary urban settings, information seekers may face challenges assessing and making use of the large quantity of information to which they have access. Such challenges may be particularly acute when laypeople are considering specialized or technical information pertaining to topics over which knowledge is contested. Within a constructivist grounded theory study of the health information practices of 39 young parents in urban Canada, a complex practice of information triangulation was observed. Triangulation comprised an iterative process of seeking, assessment, and sense-making, and typically resulted in a decision or action. This paper examines the emergent concept of information triangulation in everyday life, using data from the young parent study. Triangulation processes in this study could be classified as one of four types, and functioned as an exercise of agency in the face of structures of expertise and exclusion. Although triangulation has long been described and discussed as a practice among scientific researchers wishing to validate and enrich their data, it has rarely been identified as an everyday practice in information behavior research. Future investigations should consider the use of information triangulation for other types of information, including by other populations and in other areas of contested knowledge. © 2018 ASIS&T

AB  - This short paper examines social interaction (e.g. asking colleagues for help in the lunchroom) as an informative experience, a way to understand oneself and situation. The process of coming to an understanding is frequently hidden, but may be brought to light by examining the experiences of individuals undergoing a transition – a change that requires them to redefine their sense of self and situation. Using exemplars from previous research and drawing on Lave and Wenger's (1991) theory of situated learning, this paper explores the importance of social interaction to information practices. The role of social interaction will be discussed, including: information seeking to become part of a community, and social interaction as a source of information and as a site for information comparison (a type of information use) to situate oneself in a new environment. The paper proposes making social interaction a focus of study to better understand how individuals use information to change perception about and situate themselves.

AB  - Keeping up to date with research developments is a central activity of academic researchers, but researchers face difficulties in managing the rapid growth of available scientific information. This study examined how researchers stay up to date, using the information journey model as a framework for analysis and investigating which dimensions influence information behaviors. We designed a 2-round study involving semistructured interviews and prototype testing with 61 researchers with 3 levels of seniority (PhD student to professor). Data were analyzed following a semistructured qualitative approach. Five key dimensions that influence information behaviors were identified: level of seniority, information sources, state of the project, level of familiarity, and how well defined the relevant community is. These dimensions are interrelated and their values determine the flow of the information journey. Across all levels of professional expertise, researchers used similar hard (formal) sources to access content, while soft (interpersonal) sources were used to filter information. An important “pain point” that future information tools should address is helping researchers filter information at the point of need. © 2015 The Authors.

An experiment was performed with 20 participants in 2018. The results showed that sign designs affected users' search time length. Signs featuring library classification reduced users' search time length by 80 seconds on average in comparison with signs featuring sequential shelf numbers that were not related to subjects. It was also revealed that the system is effective for testing library sign designs. Author(s) retain copyright, but ASIS&T receives an exclusive publication license

AB  - International students face various challenges in their new countries, but research is less clear about their challenges in information behaviors. This article fills this gap by examining information behaviors of international newcomer students during adjustment to local environments, that is, local information behavior (LIB). Drawing on prior work, we focus on the local co-national context—the degree to which there are co-nationals available in one's local environments—to analyze the LIBs of 149 first-year graduate students and 57 follow-up interviewees, who were classified into: International-common group (students from China, India, and Korea—with many local co-nationals), International-less-common group (students from other countries—with fewer local co-nationals), and Domestic-out-of-state group (students from other U.S. states; control group). We identify differences in international newcomer students' use of information sources during adjustment and the role that local co-national contexts play in these differences. These results suggest ways that information scholars and practitioners might account for the influences of local co-national contexts when examining information behaviors of internationally mobile students and designing systems and services for newcomers from around the world. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - This study assessed information literacy perceptions of undergraduate students at Sultan Qaboos University in their use of social media. A quantitative approach was used to collect data from undergraduate students. The study consisted of 1,142 completed questionnaires by randomly selected participants. The results demonstrated overall moderate levels of perceptions toward the evaluation of information, information ethics, legal issues, and privacy issues. In evaluation of information, credibility of information was considered as an important factor to decide whether to use information for academic purposes. This study signifies the importance of understanding perceptions of information literacy among undergraduate students in a specific socio-cultural context. The results can also be generalized to similar academic institutions worldwide. It is also hoped that the study's findings will assist in developing contextual training programs or information literacy quizzes to promote information literacy in the social media environment. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Ali Saif Al-Aufi, Hamed Mohamed Al-Azri, and Nihad Ali Al-Hadi.

AB  - This research examines the information behavior of Indonesian women in the online community on the site femaledaily.com. This study uses a quantitative approach with a survey method. The aim is to identify women in empowering themselves in the online community. Data were obtained from 107 respondents taken in March 2018. The findings show that the reason Indonesian women use the online community femaledaily.com is to share knowledge about beauty, health, and the prices of related products. This knowledge is expressed in the form of reviews, tips, and tutorials. In addition, they are also interested in the latest and accurate information, as well as attractive site views. Most of them act as visitors and passive members. The conclusions show that the information behavior of Indonesian women in the femaledaily.com online community is seeking knowledge and becoming a member but not willing to contribute ideas. They share knowledge in the offline environment with the closest people. This is probably due to a busy life in their productive age, which has limited time. Or this is maybe caused by eastern female characters who prefer to act as individuals rather than contribute to a group. Basically, they believe in the online community because the information presented is accurate, up-to-date, complete, and in accordance with their information needs. Suggestions for members are that they should share information actively in discussion forums, while for managers of femaledaily.com, they are advised to provide appropriate experts and encourage members to participate. Future research can be done by exploring the differences in women's behavior in online and offline communities, based on a feminism perspective. © 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - This article presents the findings of a case study that examined user navigation in a large-scale digital library in the context of academic use. Using the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) as a case, the study explored user navigation and understanding of a distributed model of large-scale digital libraries. The DPLA model involves two- or three-step navigation pathways. Most study participants could navigate the DPLA distributed, multilayered system effectively. This study found some confusion among the participants when they must move through a three-step process to locate digital objects provided by a metadata aggregator service hub. The study participants also pointed out the advantages of a distributed model in collocating digital resources and connecting users to a wide range of digital libraries. © 2017 Krystyna K. Matusiak.

AB  - Sci-Hub emerged into the field of scientific communication in 2011 as a platform for free access to scientific papers. It is the most popular of the so-called shadow libraries, systems that overcome the limits of legal access to scientific publi-cations, standing apart from the open access movement. Besides from the media coverage that has served to boost its popularity, several studies reveal the impact of Sci-Hub among researchers, who have embraced this initiative. Sci-Hub has revealed new forms of access to scientific information, affecting academic and research libraries that cannot remain on the sidelines. This study addresses the Sci-Hub phenomenon and its implications for academic and research libraries from different points of view, through a bibliographic review and an analysis of examples of action. © 2019, El Profesional de la Informacion.

AB  - One direct driving factor of the stock market volatility is investors’ attention to relevant enterprise stocks and their investment behaviors, which has been widely accepted by the scholars. The development of new media has a huge impact on user information behavior, and big data technology provides a reliable data source for user behavior measurement. In this paper, we select 770 stocks from China A-shares market during 2013–2016 as a sample, and analyze the impact of attention heterogeneity in information sources and time on the performance of the stock market. Our empirical results show that the attention from search engines (Baidu and 360) and from professional financial information platform (Hexun) is significantly positively correlated with trading volume on weekdays; however, the attention from microblog (Weibo) may be negatively correlated with trading volume on weekdays and not significant. The attention heterogeneity in time makes big differences in the prediction of short-term stock returns. This paper fills in the literature gaps regarding the impact of attention heterogeneity on the performance of stock market in the era of big data. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how often geoscientists use different information sources and how this pattern of source use balances their perceptions of the quality and ease of use of the information sources. Design/methodology/approach: The geoscientists at the Geological Survey of Norway were surveyed about their information-seeking behavior. The response rate was 70 percent. Findings: The geoscientists primarily relied on web search and colleagues for information. These two information sources were perceived as easy to use, more so than bibliographic databases (GeoRef, Web of Science, and the library database). Bibliographic databases were used infrequently and perceived as yielding poorer quality results than consulting a colleague. The likelihood of using web search and colleagues to find information about a new topic was determined by the ease of using these sources. In contrast, the quality of the resulting information did not determine the frequency with which any of the information sources were used. The geoscientists who spent more time looking for information searched the web more often, had more reservations toward the quality of information obtained from colleagues, and read more journal articles and conference papers. Research limitations/implications: Geoscientists’ use of an information source is self-reinforcing and unlikely to increase through improving its quality alone. It should be noted that the study is restricted to one geoscience organization. Originality/value: The main reference about the information-seeking behavior of geoscientists is almost three decades old. This study provides an update. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Although fake news has been present in human history at any time, nowadays, with social media, deceptive information has a stronger effect on society than before. This article answers two research questions, namely (1) Is the dissemination of fake news supported by machines through the automatic construction of filter bubbles, and (2) Are echo chambers of fake news man-made, and if yes, what are the information behavior patterns of those individuals reacting to fake news? We discuss the role of filter bubbles by analyzing social media's ranking and results' presentation algorithms. To understand the roles of individuals in the process of making and cultivating echo chambers, we empirically study the effects of fake news on the information behavior of the audience, while working with a case study, applying quantitative and qualitative content analysis of online comments and replies (on a blog and on Reddit). Indeed, we found hints on filter bubbles; however, they are fed by the users' information behavior and only amplify users' behavioral patterns. Reading fake news and eventually drafting a comment or a reply may be the result of users' selective exposure to information leading to a confirmation bias; i.e. users prefer news (including fake news) fitting their pre-existing opinions. However, it is not possible to explain all information behavior patterns following fake news with the theory of selective exposure, but with a variety of further individual cognitive structures, such as non-argumentative or off-topic behavior, denial, moral outrage, meta-comments, insults, satire, and creation of a new rumor. © Franziska Zimmer, Katrin Scheibe, Mechtild Stock, Wolfgang G.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review key models of people’s information behaviour (IB) exploring the integration of the concepts of information literacy (IL) and knowledge in their designs. Scholarly perspectives portray IL as providing individuals with capacity for good information practices that result in generating new knowledge. It is surprising that this important perspective is not reflected in the reviewed IB models. This paper contributes to the literature base by proposing a new model highlighting IL and knowledge as important concepts within the IB discourse. Design/methodology/approach: A discourse of the integration of IL and knowledge, which are integral factors, associated with IB, in selected IB models. Findings: Identifying a need for information and understanding its context is an IL attribute. IL underpins IB in providing awareness of information sources; how to search and use information appropriately for solving information needs and leveraging generated new knowledge. The generation of new knowledge results from using information, in a process that combines with sense-making and adaption. Correspondingly, the knowledge that develops, increases capability for sense-making and adaptation of information to suit various contexts of need, iteratively. Originality/value: A new model of IB; the causative and outcome factors of information behaviour (COFIB) is proposed. COFIB stresses that IL and knowledge are prominent factors within the general framework of people’s IB. The model emphasises knowledge generation as the outcome of IB, applied in solving problems within specific contexts. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Computer-mediated deception threatens the security of online users’ private and personal information. Previous research confirms that humans are bad lie detectors, while demonstrating that certain observable linguistic features can provide crucial cues to detect deception. We designed and conducted an experiment that creates spontaneous deception scenarios in an interactive online game environment. Logistic regression, and certain classification methodologies were applied to analyzing data collected during fall 2014 through spring 2015. Our findings suggest that certain language-action cues (e.g., cognitive load, affective process, latency, and wordiness) reveal patterns of information behavior manifested by deceivers in spontaneous online communication. Moreover, computational approaches to analyzing these language-action cues can provide significant accuracy in detecting computer-mediated deception. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of information needs and information behavior of blue agave farmers in the municipality of Tequila, Jalisco (Mexico). Nowadays we can find many different kinds of agaveros —as these farmers are commonly called in Mexico— who are classified by some characteristic features, such as property holdings, economic power, social status, and others. There are two main groups of agaveros, the independent farmers and those who rent out land for others to cultivate. Findings show that the information needs of blue agave farmers and the information resources they consult are associated with their farming activities and daily lives. © 2016 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Investigaciones Bibliotecológicas y de la Información

AB  - As our technological capabilities for filling information needs improve, developers seek to more effective ways to support different aspects of the users' experience. One aspect that is gaining attention as an emerging support area is serendipity. However, supporting serendipity within a recommender system is difficult because the experience is unexpected and, therefore unpredictable. While researchers agree that algorithms to support serendipity need to be able to provide a balance of surprise and value to the end user (Niu & Abbas, 2017), an understanding of how to provide that balance has not yet been realized. Information that could be puzzling or distracting to someone as they go about their research activities may provide the trigger someone else needs to make a serendipitous connection in their research. Reports of serendipitous occurrences in research settings have been identified in research commentaries (Campanario, 1996) and within full-text research articles (Allen, Erdelez, & Marinov, 2013). This paper investigates the feasibility of automating the identification of information encounters in full-text research articles. This study contributes to the development of algorithms for supporting serendipity in information systems. We identified four variables that are useful for predicting information encounters in 25-35% of the instances. While we should continue to search for additional predictive variables, these findings present a novel approach to undertaking the support of serendipity in information systems.

AB  - Purpose: Economic adversity, geopolitical, and climate crises leading to the lack of decent and sustainable work are resulting in growing and diverse migratory movements. The precarious situation of many migrant workers in their countries of employment results in a state of social exclusion due to a lack of access to relevant information sources. The purpose of this paper is to further the understanding of the information behavior of migrants by examining the role that La Escuelita, a Hebrew night school for domestic migrant workers in Israel, plays as an information ground helping migrants struggling with social exclusion. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative methodology was used and data were collected using participation observation over a three-months period. Eight students at the school were interviewed using in-depth interviews. Findings: La Escuelita served as a vehicle for social inclusion by providing valuable everyday information to the students in a caring environment. Information was shared in multiple directions between both the staff and the students and between the students. Language barriers were revealed as one of the main factors for social exclusion. Findings revealed that although the migrant workers who study at La Escuelita are information poor regarding their struggle for social inclusion into Israeli society, they wish to learn Hebrew as a way to overcome this exclusion. Originality/value: Understanding the information behavior of marginalized populations is the first step into designing and implementing information services to help them toward social inclusion. This research presents an innovative contribution by examining the significance and roles of social connections in the setting of a unique information environment. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Building on theoretical foundation of personal information management (PIM) in information science, this paper seeks to understand how activity tracker users manage their personal health information generated by their devices and to elucidate future activity tracking technology in support of personal health information management (PHIM). This paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a web survey study with a specific group of activity tracker users – amateur runners. This survey collected both quantitative and qualitative data on participants’ engagement with activity tracking technology, their PHIM practices with the information generated by the technology and how their needs were being met by their activity tracking technology use and PHIM practices. Findings: Amateur runners surveyed in this study exhibit long-term engagement and frequent interaction with activity tracking technology. They also engage in PHIM practices by using a range of PHIM tools and performing various PHIM activities. Furthermore, they use activity tracking technology and engage in PHIM practices to meet various health/fitness-related needs and information needs, while some of these needs such as performance needs and overarching needs are only partially met or unmet. Originality/value: This research discusses amateur runners as power users of activity tracking technology, provides timely updates to PIM and PHIM research in light of a new type of personal health information, and generates design considerations for future activity tracking technology in support of PHIM. It also brings together previously disparate research regarding everyday life PHIM in information science, human–computer interaction and health informatics. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Everyday information behavior studies individuals' information behaviors based on their everyday experience. To analyse one participant's information behaviors across daily life contexts, we used interviews and observations as primary research methods. Findings demonstrated that one individual's regular behavioral patterns, such as cross-referencing, information reviewing, and vision driven information seeking, were consistent across contexts. This work also confirmed the potential to conduct information behavior research by closely looking into one individual across different life situations.

AB  - This paper presents a study about the information behaviour of users during spatial orientation in a hospital in Brazil. The theoretical basis of the study draws on wayfinding processes, spatial cognition and aspects of human information behaviour. Moreover, the case study reported employed the WIB-methodology. The results point out the main behavioural strategies employed by users when finding their way in a hospital, and the information barriers related to the signage and the elements of the built environment. The results ratify the need for a human centred design approach so as to develop effective wayfinding design solutions. © 2018 John Benjamins Publishing Company

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of reading in scholarly work among academics in Finland. This study analyzes readings from a variety of publication types including books, conference proceedings, research reports, magazines, newspapers, blogs, non-fiction and fiction. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was developed and distributed in Finland in 2016–2017 (n=528). Participants were asked their finding and use of scholarly information resources of all types. Findings: Scholars read from a variety of publications. Different types of publications are read and used differently. Reading also varies between disciplines, ranks, work responsibilities and type of research performed. Research limitations/implications: The study was a nationwide study of researchers in Finland; therefore, all findings are within the context of researchers in a single country. All results are self-reported; therefore, the authors assume but cannot be sure that respondents accurately recollect the specifics of their use of scholarly information. Practical implications: The results of this study are relevant to publishers, research librarians, editors and others who serve consumers of scholarly information resources, design information products and services for those scholars, and seek to better understand the information needs and use of a variety of types of scholarly publications. Originality/value: This study replicates previous studies in a variety of countries and provides a more up-to-date and single-country contextualized overview of how researchers find and use scholarly information in their work. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Psychological factors have been widely used in existing empirical studies to understand individuals’ decisions regarding HIV disclosure. However, limited studies have examined disclosure by applying a comprehensive interpersonal communication framework to understand information behaviors relevant to disclosing one's HIV status, including seeking information and sharing information. Thus the mediating role of information flow and its relationship with disclosure uncertainty for those living with HIV have been largely overlooked. We propose an integrated conceptual framework to connect the antecedent factors of disclosure decision-making, the potential route of the disclosure process, and the consequences of disclosure through integrating components from key interpersonal communication theories including the theory of communication privacy management and social influence theory and adding mediating mechanisms of “uncertainty” and “information behaviors.” Applying interpersonal communication theory and a comprehensive information management model to HIV disclosure may offer novel opportunities to support individuals living with HIV through the development of theory-based disclosure interventions to facilitate this complicated but critical process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the top researchers in information behaviour (IB) based on ideational and social influence indicators. Design/methodology/approach: The population included papers on IB indexed in the Web of Science from 1980 to 2015. UCINET and Bibexcel were the tools used for measuring the ideational and social influence indicators. The correlations among the study variables were measured by applying SPSS and LISREL. Findings: There was a significant relationship between IB researchers’ productivity and performance, and between ideational influence and social influence. The structural equation modelling showed that a researcher with top placement in his/her co-authorship network can gain higher ideational influence. In total, it seems that the single and traditional criteria are increasingly replacing new and integrative ones in measuring researchers’ scientific influence in fields including IB studies. Results have shown that based on total scores of the studied indicators, Spink, A., Nicholas, D., Ford, N., Huntington, P., Wilson, T.D., and Jamali, H.R. gained the high scores. Originality/value: The current study used an integrative method based on influence indicators to identify the influential researchers in IB studies. None of the few studies done using bibliometric methods in the realm of IB has investigated the ideational and social influence indicators altogether. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This research investigated a model of the effect of information literacy, media literacy, moral literacy, and learning & thinking skills as the construct of e-literacy maturity level through information behavior (IB) on prophetic-liberation communication behavior (PLCB). The model was constructed based on social cognitive theory (SCT) and uses and gratifications theory (UGT). P-LCB is an applied model of ethical values in the Qur'an that liberates humans from social injustice and misuse of information and communication technology. In this case, e-literacy as a personal characteristic factor will influence a person's P-LCB through IB. The study employed an explanatory-quantitative analysis. A total of 91 lecturers had been selected randomly from the total population of 989 lecturers (11 faculties) in UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta and conducted by distributing 95 statements of the questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the path analysis approach. The result reveals that e-literacy through IB has a simultaneously and significant effect on P-LCB. Partially, information behavior, learning & thinking skills, and IB significantly influence the P-LCB, while media and moral literacy do not. However, there is a significant and positive relationship between the constructs of e-literacy. The significance of this study recommends that the education of information literacy and learning & thinking skills should be integrated with media and moral literacy in increasing awareness of free media communication (P-LCB). © 2020, University of Idaho Library.

AB  - Nowadays, migrants have become the majority population of some Chinese cities, rather than a vulnerable group in the coming information society. To gain a better understanding of urban newcomers' information behavior, we interviewed 13 newcomers in China and employed grounded theory to explore how socio-cultural factors impact their information behavior. The preliminary findings show that information behavior of urban newcomers may be influenced by a complex cultural framework involving cultural integration, social integration, and cognitive value. Based on the qualitative analysis, we propose a theoretical model to understand the inner relationship, which may also yield practical implications on Chinese urban newcomers' information practices.

AB  - Aim/Purpose The objective of this paper is to review the vast literature of user-centric in-formation science and inform about the emerging themes in information be-haviour science. Background The paradigmatic shift from system-centric to user-centric approach facilitates research on the cognitive and individual information processing. Various infor-mation behaviour theories/models emerged. Methodology Recent information behaviour theories and models are presented. Features, strengths and weaknesses of the models are discussed through the analysis of the information behaviour literature. Contribution This paper sheds light onto the weaknesses in earlier information behaviour models and stresses (and advocates) the need for research on social information behaviour. Findings Prominent information behaviour models deal with individual information behaviour. People live in a social world and sort out most of their daily or work problems in groups. However, only seven papers discuss social information behaviour (Scopus search). Recommendations for Practitioners ICT tools used for inter-organisational sharing should be redesigned for effec-tive information-sharing during disaster/emergency times. Recommendation for Researchers There are scarce sources on social side of the information behaviour, however, most of the work tasks are carried out in groups/teams. Impact on Society In dynamic work contexts like disaster management and health care settings, collaborative information-sharing may result in decreasing the losses. Future Research A fieldwork will be conducted in disaster management context investigating the inter-organisational information-sharing.

AB  - Reading fiction is a neglected area of study in information behavior research, even as such research has expanded to include investigation of different kinds of behavior by more kinds of people, and an expanded repertoire of research methods and fields. Using data from a small empirical study (n=8) and research from five fields other than information science, the paper reports on participants' reading of fiction and those five fields' study of how reading fiction is informative. Considering fiction informative has two important outcomes: we (1) understand information behavior better and (2) address important problems in information science theory. Such problems include frustrated attempts to define information, the (generally hidden) gendered character of information science and information behavior research, the misguided conduit metaphor and an overemphasis on cognition at the expense of practice, documents and materiality.

AB  - A common critique is that insights from information behaviour and practises (IBP) research have difficulties to find their way to inform the design of new technologies, systems and services. There is a certain seed of truth of these statements but the situation is much more complex as are the requirements to improve the relevance of empirical observations of information activities for design and development. This panel enquires into how different approaches to IBP research can inform technology and service development in different ways, how to support interdisciplinary dialogue between IBP and systems and service design, and what novel insights from the state-of-the-art of IBP research can be drawn to support technology and service development.

AB  - Information-seeking behaviour differs among students due to the differences in their information needs and gaps. Previous studies concluded that lack of knowledge about information-seeking behaviour is one of the factors that contribute to students� failure in searching for useful information. Therefore, research on undergraduate information-seeking behaviour is important to facilitate in searching for and retrieving the required information effectively. The purpose of this paper was to develop an undergraduate information-seeking behaviour framework in seeking academic information. Data was collected using questionnaires administered to 346 undergraduate students randomly selected from Universiti Utara Malaysia. The collected data was analysed by using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Based on the findings, the undergraduate information-seeking behaviour framework in an electronic environment was developed. This framework can be adopted by lecturers to facilitate better information-search strategies during information-seeking activities in finding the relevant information effectively.

AB  - Religious beliefs have important and wide-reaching impacts on society. They also tend to be viewed as impervious to the influence of information external to a religious setting. Eight focus groups were held with attendees of two United Church of Christ congregations. Participants were asked about their core religious beliefs, and transcripts were qualitatively coded for the interplay of belief and information. Analysis found that beliefs that were focused on people, processes and events external to the congregation showed the characteristics of being more open to external information. Specifically, the breadth of these external beliefs allowed for a wider set of external information to be considered relevant; these beliefs were less biased, allowing participants to be more open to disconfirming information from outside the congregation; and these beliefs were held with less certainty, making it more likely that this disconfirming information would be attended to. This study provides suggestions for religious practitioners wishing to make the information behaviour of their organisations more open. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the information needs and information-seeking patterns of users and non-users of the Internet among rural women in Tanzania. The study used mixed research sequential design, wherein the initial qualitative phase informed the design of the cross-sectional questionnaire surveys. The study was conducted in three rural districts in Tanzania that have telecentres: Sengerema, Kongwa and Kilosa districts. In 2014, the study conducted focus group discussions (FGDs): six FGDs with 37 Internet users, and six with 36 non-users. In 2015, questionnaire surveys were administered to 90 users and 90 non-users of Internet from telecenters. The findings showed that there were similarities in the major information needs and information seeking patterns of both users and non-users of Internet, although some variations were noted. Demographic characteristics related to education level, income and number of information sources played a key role in discriminating between Internet users and non-users. This study provides empirical findings for telecenters, libraries and other rural information providers to develop and offer relevant user-centered information services that are gender sensitive, to facilitate equitable access to relevant information for rational decision-making. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Purpose - Building on studies examining the role of social media in contemporary forms of collective action and social movements, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the link between prior informational use of social media and individualized collective action. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 220 participants were surveyed in real-time during a protest against overpopulation in Singapore. Findings - Social media use was significant in disseminating information about the protest, and reflecting perceived personal relevance for specific issues. The authors found mixed motivations for attending the protest, significantly shaped by social proximity to organizers and personal relevance. Originality/value - The authors address research gaps in the link between social media use and individualized collective action, and real-time data collection during a protest. It is often difficult to study this link, given that social media may not be always the only platform used prior to a protest by participants. The case discussed here provides a unique opportunity for this to be addressed: the protest was not publicized by local mainstream media prior to the event and social media was the only place for both activists and the public to find and disseminate information about the protest. In other words, how participants used social media had a direct and meaningful impact on their participation in the protest. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2016.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the information behaviour of early career academics (ECAs) within humanities and social sciences (HSS) disciplines who are starting their first continuing academic position. The proposed grounded theory of Systemic Managerial Constraints (SMC) is introduced as a way to understand the influence of neoliberal universities on the information behaviour of ECAs. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research used constructivist grounded theory methodology. Participants were 20 Australian and Canadian ECAs from HSS. Their information practices and information behaviour were examined for a period of five to seven months using two interviews and multiple “check-ins”. Data were analysed through two rounds of coding, where codes were iteratively compared and contrasted. Findings: SMC emerged from the analysis and is proposed as a grounded theory to help better understand the context of higher education and its influence on ECAs’ information behaviour. SMC presents university managerialism, resulting from neoliberalism, as pervasive and constraining both the work ECAs do and how they perform that work. SMC helps to explain ECAs’ uncertainty and precarity in higher education and changing information needs as a result of altered work role, which, in turn, leads ECAs to seek and share information with their colleagues and use information to wield their personal agency to respond to SMC. Originality/value: The findings from this paper provide a lens through which to view universities as information environments and the influence these environments can have on ECAs’ information practices and information behaviour. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Currently there are many groups of Indonesian faculty members on social media. This research aims to find out the information behavior of Indonesian faculty members on social media, especially on Facebook, Telegram, and WhatsApp. The focus of this research is in-depth understanding of the needs, search, organization, and use of information by Indonesian faculty members on social media. This research is qualitative research using a virtual ethnographic approach. The research data was obtained through participatory observation, in-depth interviews, and a literature review. The selection of informants was done by purposive sampling, while triangulation was done by data sources and theories triangulation. The results showed that the information behavior of Indonesian faculty members on social media began with the need for information, choosing social media, choosing and entering into one or several groups, sharing information, and discussing in a group. Some faculty members keep the information, and some choose to ask when they need the information, even though the information has been discussed. The information obtained is used when they need it, and they usually share their experiences with other group members. © Nuning Kurniasih, 2019.

AB  - In interactive information retrieval, researchers consider the user behaviour towards systems and search tasks in order to adapt search results and to improve the search experience of users. Analysing the users’ past interactions with the system is one typical approach. In this paper, we analyse the user behaviour in retrieval sessions towards Marcia Bates’ search stratagems such as “Footnote Chasing”, “Citation Searching”, “Keyword Searching”, “Author Searching” and “Journal Run” in a real-life academic search engine. In fact, search stratagems represent high-level search behaviour as the users go beyond simple execution of queries and investigate more of the system functionalities. We performed analyses of these five search stratagems using two datasets extracted from the social sciences search engine sowiport. A specific focus was the detection of the search phase and frequency of the usage of these stratagems. In addition, we explored the impact of these stratagems on the whole search process performance. We addressed mainly the usage patterns’ observation of the stratagems, their impact on the conduct of retrieval sessions and explored whether they are used similarly in both datasets. From the observation and metrics proposed, we can conclude that the utilisation of search stratagems in real retrieval sessions leads to an improvement of the precision in terms of positive interactions. For both datasets (SUSS 14–15 and SUSS 16–17), the user behaviour was similar as all stratagems appear most frequently in the middle of a session. However, the difference is that “Footnote Chasing”, “Citation Searching” and “Journal Run” appear mostly at the end of a session while Keyword and Author Searching appear typically at the beginning. Thus, we can conclude from the log analysis that the improvement of search functionalities including personalisation and/or recommendation could be achieved by considering references, citations, and journals in the ranking process. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a study that explored public perceptions of the credibility of “facts and figures” contained within five social media posts produced by political parties in Scotland. Design/methodology/approach: The study consisted of an online survey conducted in Spring 2017 (n=538). Respondents were asked to gauge the reliability of “facts” contained within the posts, to provide reasons for their answers, and to indicate how they might go about confirming or debunking the figures. Findings: Less than half the sample believed the posts’ content would be reliable. Credibility perceptions were influenced by various factors, including: a lack of cited sources; concerns about bias or spin; a lack of detail, definitions or contextual information; personal political allegiance and trust; negative campaign techniques; personal experience of policy issues; and more intuitive judgements. Only small numbers admitted that they would not know how to find out more about the issues or would be disinclined to look further. The majority appeared confident in their own abilities to find further information, yet were vague in describing their search strategies. Originality/value: Relatively little empirical research has been conducted exploring the perceived credibility of political or government information online. It is believed that this is the first such study to have specifically investigated the Scottish political arena. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Human Information Behavior (HIB) research commonly examines behavior in the context of why information is acquired and how it will be used, but usually at the level of the work or everyday-life tasks the information will support. HIB has not been examined in detail at the broader contextual level of intellectual purpose (that is, the higher-order conceptual tasks the information was acquired to support). Examination at this level can enhance holistic understanding of HIB as a “means to an intellectual end” and inform the design of digital information environments that support information interaction for specific intellectual purposes. We investigate information-based ideation (IBI) as a specific intellectual information acquisition and use context by conducting Critical Incident-style interviews with 10 game designers, focusing on how they interact with information to generate and develop creative design ideas. Our findings give rise to a framework of their ideation-focused HIB, which systems designers can leverage to reason about how best to support certain behaviors to drive design ideation. These findings emphasize the importance of intellectual purpose as a driver for acquisition and desired outcome of use. © 2018 ASIS&T

AB  - The connections and contexts surrounding information shared in social settings must be accounted for, and this is particularly true for online communities that are information-centric. This article presents a mixed-methods study of LibraryThing and Goodreads, which have characteristics of information-centric online communities and social digital libraries, with attention to their roles as boundary objects, users' information values, and information behavior, and other boundaries and boundary objects at play. Content analysis of messages, a survey of users, and qualitative interviews show LibraryThing and Goodreads help establish community and organizational structure; support sharing of information values; and facilitate the building and maintenance of social ties. Translation of meanings and understandings within and between communities is a key activity in these roles. Online communities and social digital libraries should highlight translation processes and resources; provide user profiles and off-topic spaces and encourage their use; take a sociotechnical approach to tailor technology and community features to the right audiences; and facilitate the establishment of shared structure, values, and ties and the work of boundary spanners. Further implications exist for research on and theorizing of information-centric online communities, boundaries, and boundary objects as part of the sociotechnical infrastructure surrounding online information sharing. © 2019 ASIS&T

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to elaborate the picture of the motivators for information behaviour by examining the nature of information need as a trigger and driver of information seeking. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual analysis was made by focussing on the ways in which researchers have conceptualised information need in models for human information behaviour (HIB). The study draws on conceptual analysis of 26 key studies focussing on the above topic. Findings: Researchers have employed two main approaches to conceptualise information needs in the HIB models. First, information need is approached as a root factor which motivates people to identify and access information sources. Second, information need is approached as a secondary trigger or driver determined by more fundamental factors, for example, the information requirements of task performance. The former approach conceptualises information need as a trigger providing an initial impetus to information seeking, while the latter approach also depicts information need as a driver that keeps the information-seeking process in motion. The latter approach is particularly characteristic of models depicting information seeking as a cyclic process. Research limitations/implications: As the study focusses on information need, no attention is devoted to related constructs such as anomalous state of knowledge and uncertainty. Originality/value: The study pioneers by providing an in-depth analysis of the nature of information need as a trigger and driver of information seeking. The findings refine the picture of motivators for information behaviour. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - While information resources have contributed to the overall decline in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in the United States, these benefits have not been experienced equally. Our article describes formative research conducted as part of a larger study focused on the development of an online HIV prevention platform tailored for Black female college students. To inform the design of our platform, we conducted focus groups with 60 Black women enrolled at two predominantly White institutions (PWIs). The purpose of the focus groups was to understand information needs, awareness of specific information resources, and the search strategies employed for finding and evaluating HIV prevention information. We used hypervisibility as a sensitizing lens for making sense of how the intersecting gender and racial identities of Black womanhood shape information-seeking behavior. Four themes emerged: platform choice and privacy, relatability, respectability politics, and silence on campus. The themes depict discursive representations specific to Black female identity to manage stigma, reduce their hypervisibility, and amplify their authentic voices in the broader HIV prevention discourse. Our findings contribute to human information behavior scholarship on marginalized groups. © 2018 ASIS&T

AB  - That university students encounter issues and experience frustration when using ebooks is well documented, but more research into the specific issues they encounter is needed. This study focused on how successfully undergraduate and graduate students use ebooks and whether there are measurable differences between the two groups. Researchers employed user testing methodologies, including task analysis and talk aloud protocol, to research student interaction with the content and structure of ebooks on two platforms: ProQuest Ebook Central and EBSCO eBooks. Findings include suggested improvements for ebook platforms, considerations for collection development librarians, and areas of focus for library instructors. © 2019, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © 2019, © Erin DeWitt Miller, Allyson Rodriguez, and Susan Smith.

AB  - Gender is a salient feature of identity that is rarely questioned in our physical encounters. We are usually not confused about a person's gender—generally it's male or female. However, as the adoption of computer-mediated communication increases, our social reliance on these technologies has made gender easily disguised online. And yet, the phenomenon of gender deception has not been fully investigated. This study adopts a path analysis to examine interconnected cognitive factors that impact online users’ ability to deceive—and detect deception—regarding gender. An asynchronous online game was developed to simulate situations where males were incentivized to communicate like females, and females were incentivized to communicate like males. Twelve hypotheses were tested using path analysis, which resulted in our realization that an actor's true gender can affect the motivation to deceive; males tend to have higher self-efficacy beliefs in gender deception, and females tend to have a higher success rate in detecting gender deception. Our research suggests that the gender of the message recipient could be a significant factor in uncovering gender deception. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The range of theoretical frameworks currently being used by researchers into information behaviour is abundant and diverse. We need to examine thoroughly the contribution of theories and models to further research, as this would help to improve future investigations in the field. This paper adopts this approach, by thoroughly examining the influence that Elfreda Chatman’s three middle-range theories have had on subsequent research. A citation context analysis was carried out on the basis of those received by Information poverty theory, life in the round theory and normative behaviour theory. Analysis covered the year of publication, the type of work and the subject-matter of the citing documents. The cites in context or theoretical incidents were analysed for frequency of citation in citing documents, the content of Chatman’s work being cited, the context co-citation analysis, the citation style and the citation location. The analysis of citation in context has allowed us to draw a distinction between the author and her work, while verifying that not all cites are the same. These differences reflect the unequal relevance of these theories to subsequent research. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Information behavior addresses how individuals use information throughout the various contexts of their daily lives. Previous research in the field has explored passive information behaviors, but not addressed them in the quotidian aspects of life, such as grocery shopping. The current work fills this gap by addressing passive information behaviors throughout the grocery shopping process providing useful insights into how individuals interact with information in a new domain. Data was gathered through two empirical studies using qualitative methods emphasizing the lived experience of primary grocery shoppers. Findings show that information encountering, browsing and monitoring are prevalent in the grocery store and during the planning of a shopping trip demonstrating the information richness of grocery shopping. © Melissa G.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the problem of information and knowledge management (IKM) in higher education institutions. The research aims to determine the way in which the knowledge resources of a higher education institution are managed. The author intends to define how the information system is shaped and how information and knowledge are used in the reporting processes and for decision-making efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 38 university administration employees from six higher education institutions in Poland participated in the study. Information barriers and benefits resulting from the implementation of the central reporting system “POL-on” were identified by using the sense-making technique. The purpose of the interviews was to determine the procedural and behavioural conditions of the reporting and decision-making processes in higher education institutions in Poland. Findings: This paper suggests four characteristics of IKM in higher education institutions. A link between the information culture of the institution, its size and structure as well as the adopted model of IKM is demonstrated. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a framework for studying the IKM in higher education institutions from the perspective of information culture. Higher education institutions have developed different styles of striving for efficiency regarding decision making and reporting in administration. The IM and KM are now proved to be an integrated process in administrative activities of higher education institutions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the information behaviour of Facebook users that follow a fan page focused on Brazilian Popular Music (BPM). The conceptual framework used was Wilson revis-ited model for information behaviour. Qualitative research was conducted in two steps. i) First, a net-nography of users on the page “com açucar, com af-eto” in Facebook was conducted to find patterns of collective behaviour, and specific actions and ii) an interview with 32 users was performed to collect data about their perception. The netnography revealed collective behaviours when observing shares, likes, and comments, it helped to discover in which posts, authors or even content is more popular and how the users react to each post. The users of Facebook page “Com açucar, com afeto” fill the emotional and cognitive needs of its visitors; initially, users look to the page due the interest in BPM, but the use of the page evolves to fill emotional and cognitive needs to share experience based on feelings and emotions brought by music. Three intervening variables appear as the most significant in the information behaviour of us-ers: i) Psychological, ii) Social and interpersonal role and iii) the environment itself. © 2019, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

AB  - The article explores the influence of online participation on individual-level support for burden-sharing measures among EU member states. The analysis is set against the backdrop of the discussion about solidarity in times of EU crises and follows an innovative approach by operationalizing social inclusion in the European Union via online participation. It is argued that the specific nature of the European Union favors the use of online channels for political information and participation, but that despite its inclusive potential, online participation does not necessarily mean public support for the European Union. Instead, we hypothesize that people who make more use of online participation channels—thus are supposedly better equipped to participate in EU politics—are more critical in their evaluation of burden-sharing measures. Based on a large-scale survey among EU citizens in late 2016, we conduct a regression analysis taking into account the influence of EU support and general considerations on solidarity. Results lend support to our hypothesis that people who participate in political affairs online do not express greater support for EU burden-sharing measures but are more critical. Results are interpreted as an expression of the constraining dissensus regarding EU politics: Negative effects are read as criticism of how solidarity in the European Union is implemented, not as opposition to solidarity in the European Union as such. © 2019 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between preferred choice of school subject and student information behaviour (IB). Design/methodology/approach: Mixed methods were employed. In all, 152 students, teachers and librarians participated in interviews or focus groups. In total, 1,375 students, key stage 3 (11-14 years) to postgraduate, responded to a questionnaire. The research population was drawn from eight schools, two further education colleges and three universities. Insights from the literature review and the qualitative research phase led to a hypothesis which was investigated using the questionnaire: that students studying hard subjects are less likely to engage in deep IB than students studying soft subjects. Findings: Results support the hypothesis that preferences for subjects at school affect choice of university degree. The hypothesis that a preference for hard or soft subjects affects IB is supported by results of an analysis in which like or dislike of maths/ICT is correlated with responses to the survey. Interviewees’ comments led to the proposal that academic subjects can be classified according to whether a subject helps students to acquire a “tool of the Mind” or to apply such a tool. A model suggesting how IB may differ depending on whether intellectual tools are being acquired or applied is proposed. Practical implications: The “inner logic” of certain subjects and their pedagogies appears closely linked to IB. This should be considered when developing teaching programmes. Originality/value: The findings offer a new perspective on subject classification and its association with IB, and a new model of the association between IB and tool acquisition or application is proposed, incorporating the perspectives of both teacher and student. © 2018, Andrew D.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between internet filtering, emotions and information-seeking behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 15 postgraduate students at an Iranian university participated in the study which involved a questionnaire, search tasks with think aloud narratives, and interviews. Findings: Internet content filtering results in some changes in the information-seeking behaviour of users. Users who face website blocking use a variety of methods to bypass filtering, mostly by using anti-filter software. Filtering encourages users to use channels such as social networking services to share resources and it increases the use of library material by some of the users. Users who face filtering during their search are more likely to visit more pages of results and click on more hits in the results, unlike users who do not experience filtering who rarely go past the first page. Blocking users’ access to content stimulates their curiosity and they become more determined to access the content. In terms of the affective aspect, filtering causes several negative emotions (e.g. anger, disgust, sadness and anxiety) and the main reason for these emotions is not the inability to access information but the feeling of being controlled and not having freedom. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to a small number of postgraduate students in social sciences and not generalisable to all user groups. The implication is that in countries where filtering is used, libraries can play an important role in serving users and reducing users negative emotions, especially if libraries can take advantage of technologies such as social media for their services. Originality/value: This is first study to address the effects of internet filtering on information-seeking behaviour and emotions. The study shows that internet filtering causes negative emotions and results in some changes in information-seeking behaviour. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Part-time and Distance education is fast gaining global acceptance with millions of enrolments annually. Stakeholders have argued that, just like regular students, those who chose this mode of study deserve the highest quality services available. As a result, Library and Information service providers are seeking to understand this group of users in order to properly meet their information needs and design services that best fit their unique characteristics. The study thus examined the availability and use of Library and Information Services by Part-time, Students at Lead City University, Ibadan, Nigeria. A self administered questionnaire was used to gather data. The data collected were analyzed using the SPSS for Windows Version 20. Descriptive analysis was performed on the data which yielded percentages, frequencies, means, and standard deviation that described the central tendency and sample distribution. The study found that, although they have diverse information needs, part -time students have limited access to the resources and services of the Lead City University Library and majority of them turn to other sources that are easily within reach like the internet. In the light of the findings, the study recommended that libraries should take the advantage of ICT in facilitating remote access to electronic format of books and journals and extend Information literacy services to part-time students. © 2019 Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - Purpose: The purposoe of this paper was to study the information needs and information-seeking among Thai farmers that lead the development of a mobile phone application for the purpose of production and marketing promotion. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative research was performed by in-depth interviews, observations, field notes and content analysis. The 48 primary informants were the best-practice farmers around Songkhla Lake Basin. Findings: The results demonstrate the farmers’ need for information on the following topics: increasing production, developing quality, reducing costs, manufacturing products, increasing marketing and sales channels and changing to short-lived crops. The farmers acquired information directly targeted to their needs and behaviors by making inquiries, exchanging ideas and joining study trips and training, which resulted in production and marketing promotion and, hence, higher incomes. Originality/value: As a result, their farming will yield high-quality products, bringing them more income and a better standard of living. When the lives of the farmers, who are the majority of the Thailand population, are improved, the holistic conditions of national economic development will in turn be good, leading to security, wealth and sustainability. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Considering the perceived significance of librarians and information experts as professional information seekers and information seeking educators and of the institutional setting of information work, very little is known about the information practices of librarians and information professionals, their contexts and implications for libraries and their users. The aim of this study is to explore the information interactions of library professionals within and in relation to the context of the setting of the library. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a qualitative case study of a large North European city library. Material was collected using information seeking diaries, interviews and ethnographic observation in the library space. Findings: The information practices of librarians are contextual to the setting of the library within which the meeting of the assumptions of library users, of the use of that particular system plays a significant role. The systemic interplay of librarians, library users and other parts of the system constrains the breadth of the available information at libraries, but at the same time, keeping to a particular set of shared norms and practices of library use also facilitates the use of the system. Research limitations/implications: The generalisability of the findings is limited by the fact that they are based on an individual case study. Practical implications: The systemic nature of library and its reproduction in a process of structuration underlines the need to develop information services in libraries from a holistic perspective that takes into account the practical implications of the shared norms and assumptions of how a library should work. Originality/value: There is little earlier research on the information practices of library and information professionals, particularly with specific reference to its implications for libraries and their users. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of personality (intellectual curiosity, conscientiousness and negative emotionality) and approach to studying (deep, strategic and surface) on students’ learning-related information behaviour in inquiry tasks.; Design/methodology/approach-Data were collected from 219 senior high school students with the use of three questionnaires. Findings-The findings showed that students’ individual traits influenced different aspects of their learning-related information behaviour from information need to information use.; Research limitations/implications-The results were based on survey data. Reliability issues with the scales are discussed. In future research qualitative data would enrich the understanding of the phenomena.; Practical implications-The results are informative for teachers and librarians who guide students in inquiry tasks.; Originality/value-The study spanned learning-related information behaviour across the whole inquiry process: from task construction through task performance to task completion. The findings showed that individual traits were particularly influential at the task completion stage, that is on information use. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - As part of a wider study of the relevance of the principles and practices of the Slow Movement to the information disciplines and professions, a Delphi study was carried out with 17 researchers in information behaviour and practices. A novel variant of the Delphi technique, termed the Slow Delphi, was devised for this study. This is aimed at eliciting qualitative understanding of complex conceptual topics, where there are a variety of perspectives and positions to be considered. The results of the study show a variety of points of potential applicability of Slow principles in research into information behaviour and practices, and in information provision. These include: more explicit inclusion of a temporal dimension in information behaviour models; greater recognition of the importance of the tempo of information seeking; more critical consideration of speed and scale as factors in the information environment; and the potential for individuals to exercise greater control over their information environment. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - This article investigates the use of a hand-held unit as an information source in manual assembly. Having a mobile information system, such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), that can be brought at all times, as opposed to a stationary one, such as a computer terminal, is hypothesised to increase the information range and thus improves assembly performance. The increased information range is argued to be due to assembly workers employing a cost-benefit strategy, where the cost of gathering information is compared with the assumed benefit of it. This article reports empirical data comparing the use of a mobile information carrier with a traditional stationary computer, and results show that the use of a PDA significantly improves quality, whereas productivity does not significantly improve quality. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between information and coping from the experiences of young people coping with long term illness. Design/methodology/approach: Situational analysis was used as a methodological approach. It has roots in the Chicago Symbolic Interactionism School. Cartographic approaches enabled the analysis, mapping the complexities emerging from the data. Findings: As the young people became more informed about their health conditions, and gained knowledge and understanding both about their illnesses, their own bodies and boundaries, their confidence and capacity to cope increased. Gaining confidence, the young people often wanted to share their knowledge - becoming information providers themselves. From the data, five positions on an information-coping trajectory were identified: information deficiency; feeling ill-informed; needing an injection of information; having information health; and becoming an information donor. Research limitations/implications: The research was limited to an analysis of 30 narratives. The paper contributes to information theory by mapping clearly the relationship between information and coping. Practical and social implications: The study establishes a relationship between levels of information and knowledge and the ability to cope with illness. Originality/value: The information theories in this study have originality and multi-disciplinary value in the management of health and illness, and information studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - A model of information interaction, based on the activities of disc jockeys (DJs) provides a valuable conceptual framework for working in large digital collections. Their processes and workflow demonstrate creative information behaviours that are transferable to other data-representations; as such the model represents a new take on read/write systems of interaction for creative development in archives of all kinds, and provides a platform for learning and authoring with digital collections.

AB  - Academic librarians are striving to better serve international students as this emerging population grows on university campuses. Past studies of international students generally focus on linguistic and cultural differences in relation to information literacy skills development. However, it is necessary to go beyond these factors to better serve the population. By using a framework based in information behavior research, the present study investigates the factors that mediate students' behavior and information literacy skills. Practical recommendations based on the findings of an in-depth qualitative study of students' research process are provided. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Application of the results of an information behavior study and domain analysis of Classics scholars of Latin, graduate students, and high school teachers are presented. The study was conducted to inform the design of the Digital Latin Library. Interviews and task demonstrations were conducted with 16 participants. An in depth domain analysis was also conducted to help researchers and system developers further understand the discipline of Classics and the unique system needs of this community. This paper outlines the detailed work analysis of one aspect of the Classical scholars' scholarly work, development of a critical edit ion, and shows how we modeled this process within the system design. We also illustrate how the rich findings produced from information behavior studies and domain analysis can be used in information representation design of complex, discipline specific systems. Further, it shows how the two methodological approaches within LIS can be used together. Copyright © 2016 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - The ultimate goal of information distribution for a destination marketer is to stimulate travelers to make a purchase decision. Today, travel information can be obtained by travel technology, which enables travelers to exploit on-the-move information. Navigation services for travel technology are being more broadly used across the globe by providing a wide range of en route information. This study evaluates the effects of travel information disseminated by navigation services on unplanned behaviors during trips. The results of the study illustrate that travelers who use navigation during trips are more likely to be involved in unplanned activities and, hence, will have an increase in unplanned travel expenditures. Destination marketers can partner with travel technology providers to encourage better travel experiences for tourists and generate more travel revenues for the tourism industry. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The authors surveyed 250 students, faculty, alumni, administrators, and staff about how they use mobile devices, if at all, to access a university library. Fifty percent of respondents reported that they used their mobile devices to access the library—primarily the catalog and the research databases; however, usability hindered accessing other desired services. These results have implications for library administrators with respect to making decisions about App choices, the advertisement of services, and the transition to e-collections. © , Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Information behavior research has typically explored individual-level practices, even within studies of groups and group activities. Although collaborative information seeking has emerged in recent years to explore how people search for and share information, much of this research also focuses on individual-level experiences. Collectivist approaches to information behavior have been conducted in only a few studies in the discipline; however, collectivism offers a unique, holistic way to study information practices at within-group levels. Collectivism also accounts for the social, professional, and other contextual elements that shape group members' information practices when pursuing common shared goals. This exploratory qualitative study used focus groups situated in a constructivist grounded theory methodology to investigate wine industry members' experiences while engaging in peer mentoring circles. Designed as a professional development activity, the mentoring circles provided a platform for the development of long-term relationships among group members to foster information sharing and knowledge creation relevant to their work environments. The emergent results make a significant contribution to the field as they outline key conditions under which collectivist groups support members' information needs. Findings point to the importance of group cohesion developed through shared (industry-based) language and knowledge and development of kin-like relationships to generate unique knowledge communities. Interdependency and reciprocity are shown to play key roles in motivating individual group members to share information with their peers.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a quantitative study of personality aspects and their relationship with web search information behavior. We start with introducing personality and give an overview of information behavior research concerning personality aspects. In our study of 30 participants, their personality traits were operationalized by using a version of the Big 5, the B5T, a psychometric questionnaire that maps personality on different dimensions. The participants performed search tasks in a web context and data concerning their information behavior was collected via search logs as well as questionnaires. We show that there are selective correlations of slight and intermediate strength between the variables of information behavior and the personality dimensions. Finally, we discuss possible explanations and implications as well as new impulses for information behavior and retrieval research. © 2016 Thomas Schmidt and Christian Wolff.

AB  - In this brief contribution I argue that an apparent dichotomy between information behavior seen as the behavior of individuals and their respective information styles and information behavior considered as a social practice may be resolved by considering the underresearched corporeality of the human body aka embodiment, which is a fundamental aspect of any kind of behavior, including information behavior. Practice is inherently embodied too, which means embodiment can be utilized as a vantage point to seek conceptual grounding for the rather diverse range of theories and models in information behavior research. The challenge then is to articulate in what ways and on what levels a particular approach contributes to advancing information behavior research. Conceptual clarity would also help information behavior models and theories developed in libraries and information science become more accessible and hopefully also more relevant to researchers in cognate disciplines. © 2015 ASIS&T.

AB  - The study of information science and technology has expanded over the years to include more kinds of people, more kinds of behavior, more methods, and a broader inclusion of fields. There is at least one area, however, where very few information studies scholars have tread: entertainment, particularly fiction. Yet many fields indicate that information studies should consider fiction. In this paper, we discuss how fiction is an informative genre and reasons why information studies scholars have mostly ignored fiction. We also identify potential research directions for studying fiction. We provide a summary of works about fiction and information, discuss motivations for expanding (and not expanding) information studies beyond what it is and has been, and we use an exploratory study of one example of a fiction-interaction – reading Young Adult novels – to illustrate how fiction is important to information behavior. © 2016 Ramona Broussard, Philip Doty.

AB  - Although people engage in a range of information behaviors, the majority of previous models and empirical research in information behavior tend to focus just on information seeking and use. This panel will discuss the need of extending the territories of information behavior research beyond seeking and use. Panelists will explain their own research studies that explore different forms of information behavior, and introduce emerging models including serendipitous finding of information, information-organizing behavior, and information-creating behavior. Theoretical and methodological issues concerning modeling the new modes of information behavior will be discussed. This panel will involve the audience in identifying under-investigated areas of information behavior and discussing potential impacts of studying various forms of information behavior on individuals, society, organizations, systems & technology, and culture.

AB  - Focusing on information behaviours in the context of everyday life, this study seeks to explore the information needs and uses of international students— one of the fastest-growing student groups within the university—in their daily activities. Using data from 60 respondents to the survey questionnaire and a total of 263 information activities from the online diary survey of 28 participants, this study investigated four research questions regarding information needs, information sources, the digital devices used for information searches, and the relationships between information needs, information sources, and digital devices in international students' daily information environments. The findings demonstrate that international students with diverse information needs sought information from a wide range of information sources, including search engines and human-mediated sources, using portable digital devices for their information searches. This study revealed that participants used different information sources and digital devices depending on the type of information needs. The findings provide useful insights into the information services available to international students in a higher education context. © 2015 The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present the case for studies of information behaviour in the use of immersive documents. Immersive documents, where unreality is perceived as reality, arise from a combination of rapidly developing technologies and applications: pervasive and networked information, multi-sensory interaction and the creation of participatory texts. Design/methodology/approach – A critical and selective analysis of relevant literature is presented. Findings – Immersive documents are likely to have a significant effect on library/information service provision, as it is to expected that novel information behaviours will emerge as these documents become widely used. Studies of immersive information behaviour and practices will be valuable in planning for how library/information services can best provide access to such documents, and may also guide the development of such documents. They may also contribute to the development of information behaviour research generally, and to better interaction between research and practice. Research limitations/implications – As such documents are not yet in wide use, the conclusions are necessarily speculative. Originality/value – This is the first paper to discuss information behaviour in respect of immersive documents. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Informed by the knowledge gap theory, this study explored possible hypotheses on information-seeking satisfaction gaps. Using a survey of 1,000 Singapore Internet users and an ANOVA test, this research tested whether individuals’ satisfaction with everyday information seeking varies by demographics and by the frequency of information sources usage. Interaction effects were also tested. Significant differences were found in the satisfaction level based on the income level and on the frequency of using all four sources tested. Three interactions were significant, two of which suggest lower satisfaction among lower socioeconomic status individuals who used the Internet or social media with moderate frequency. Five propositions were introduced for further testing. Copyright © 2015 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - A persona represents a group of target users that share common behavioural characteristics. The personas method, an approach to systems design, has been receiving significant attention from practitioners. However, only anecdotal evidence currently exists for the effectiveness of personas and there have been criticisms about its validity as a scientific approach to research. This paper attempts to demonstrate how incorporating personas may lead to better understand the information needs of humanities scholars. Humanities scholars in an advanced ICT environment in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan are sampled as a case. Previous studies show that the humanities scholars have a significant negative relation with ICT use; they are using it less than scientists and social scientists, and they demonstrate a significantly higher use of library facilities than other academics. There is also a lack of up-to-date international research on the humanities scholars' information needs that takes into account recent rapid increases in the availability of ICT infrastructure, especially the Internet. As such, the objective of this study is to understand the information needs of humanities scholars and the effect of the electronic environment on their information seeking behaviour using personas. This study is conducted within a conceptual framework based on an integration of existing models of information-seeking behaviour, along with additional new elements representing the information context environment, such as languages, decision to seek and format of information resources. The four personas that were uncovered in this study may be able to effectively communicate the actual information needs of the humanities scholars through the personal narrative, name, and face, which continuously will remind the academic library of what their users really want and need from their services. This study also lays the foundation for future research by identifying variables of interest, and building construct validity through the themes of information needs that emerged. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The study aimed to investigate the information disclosure behavior of women bloggers who suffer from infertility by examining their self-disclosure as it relates to the anonymity patterns they adopted. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was distributed to approximately 300 authors of infertility blogs, 135 bloggers answered the request to take part in the study. The survey gathered basic demographic and blogging practice data, and measured different elements of the bloggers' discursive and visual anonymity as well as their patters of self-disclosure. Findings: Findings reveal that the majority of respondents identify themselves on their blogs and only a small percentage decided to be totally anonymous, and about half of the bloggers post actual photos of themselves and their lives. The participants reported a high rate of self-disclosure, revealing sensitive information, letting their defenses down, disclosing highly intimate details about their lives, writing openly about their infertility treatments on their blog. No significant correlation was observed between visual and discursive anonymity and the perceived self-disclosure of participants. Results show that the more anonymous the bloggers are, the more afraid they become that their blog may be read by people they know offline. On the other hand, the more identifiable the bloggers are, the more willingness they show to share the content of their journal with people they know offline. The majority of participants expressed concerns that blogging could negatively impact their lives. Originality/value: This study explores an alternate explanation through the examination of the bloggers' self-disclosure patterns as they relate to the degree of anonymity adopted. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper was to study the information behavior of farmers regarding value adding in production and marketing. This paper is a component of a larger and more comprehensive research study of farmers and their behavior regarding the acquisition and use of information. Design/methodology/approach – This research was qualitative and based on the Grounded Theory. In-depth interviews, observations and field survey recordings were conducted to collect data. Pan Tae Sub-district, Khuan Khanun District, Phatthalung Province, Thailand was selected as the research field site. The sample consisted of 14 key informants selected by the theoretical sampling technique. These informants were successful in value adding to their production and marketing process. Findings – Farmers require information because of problems associated with low product prices and being taken advantage of by middlemen. Farmers’ information-seeking behavior includes: transfer of information from governmental academic officers and community leaders, exchanges of information among community farmers and training/study trips. Farmers use information in brand building, product differentiation and development of product quality, all with the main objective of increasing income. Originality/value – Information behaviors of farmers were theoretically summarized from farmers’ development in their social and farming context. The new and expanded knowledge obtained from a Thai context will be useful for the science and profession of library and information science. This information will also improve methods of communicating valuable information to farmers, thereby improving productivity and quality of life. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Recently, social movements worldwide have introduced innovations in their communication methods. The #spanishrevolution that started on 15 May 2011 shows this new-style communication in action. Amidst regional election campaigning, thousands of people, mainly young, took to the streets and occupied Spain’s main squares, becoming known as the Outraged (los Indignados) or 15M Movement. This article evaluates how the Outraged involved with the #acampadabcn, the camp in Barcelona’s central square, used online–offline tools to get information about the Movement. This research combines participant observation, surveys, in-depth interviews, and web analytics. The results show that social media were vital for getting information during 15M. While the majority of those surveyed became aware of the camps via word of mouth, a posteriori it was social media that were the main tools for informing and mobilizing. 15M Movement, together with networked social movements, has updated the communication methods of social movements. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - This study analyzed how churches create cultures in which the recirculating of the same information is encouraged, or cultures in which new information is introduced regularly. It then analyzed how these cultures impact engagement with important knowledge management (KM) principles. Particular attention was paid to the factors that contribute to a church's decision to engage in a critical questioning of assumed beliefs—productive inquiry (PI)—shown to be an important behavior in successful organizations. In eight, 90-minute focus groups, 28 congregants from Mainline Protestant churches were asked to discuss the information behavior surrounding their religious beliefs. Qualitative coding and analysis revealed that the introduction of shared information produced barriers to PI, and the introduction of unique information encouraged PI. However, congregations were purposive in their decision to either engage or disengage in this inquiry based on organizational goals. Analysis showed that the decision to engage with PI was dependent upon a number of variables. A model is provided that outlines the necessary conditions for a congregation with a goal of either PI, or its conceptual opposite—reaffirmation of existing information and beliefs. This reaffirmation tended to result from a relationship goal, but it is suggested that this relationship goal might be better achieved through PI. This study has important implications for organizations that could benefit from the implementation of KM but are less receptive to its requirements.

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of cognitive style on navigating a large digital library of cultural heritage information; specifically, the paper focus on the wholist/ analytic dimension as experienced in the field of educational informatics. The hypothesis is that wholist and analytic users have characteristically different approaches when they explore, search and interact with digital libraries, which may have implications for system design.; Design/methodology/approachÂ­A detailed interactive IR evaluation of a large cultural heritage digital library was undertaken, along with the Riding CSA test. Participants carried out a range of information tasks, and the authors analysed their task performance, interactions and attitudes.; Findings-The hypothesis on the differences in performance and behaviour between wholist and analytic users is supported. However, the authors also find that user attitudes towards the system are opposite to expectations and that users give positive feedback for functionality that supports activities in which they are cognitively weaker.; Research limitations/implications-There is scope for testing results in a larger scale study, and/ or with different systems. In particular, the findings on user attitudes warrant further investigation.; Practical implications-Findings on user attitudes suggest that systems which support areas of weakness in users’ cognitive abilities are valued, indicating an opportunity to offer diverse functionality to support different cognitive weaknesses.; Originality/value-A model is proposed suggesting a converse relationship between behaviour and attitudes; to support individual users displaying search/navigation behaviour mapped onto the strengths of their cognitive style, but placing greater value on interface features that support aspects in which they are weaker. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Due to social and political change the process of young citizens’ political socialization was put on a new basis in West European democracies over the last decades. In this article we discuss some aspects of this development and show their consequences. We analyse empirical findings from Germany, focussing on the relevant social factors which influence the individual propensity to participate in politics. The impact of the financial and economic crisis in Europe on political attitudes will also be considered, taking in account sociological aspects. Based on the empirical findings we discuss implications for civic education. In contrast to many discussions in literature about this issue, in which the focus is on the need to put the various influences of political socialization into a broader context, we argue that the parental social background is the crucial upstream factor, prior to e.g. civic education. The conclusion indicates that a group-specific educational approach, taking into account the social background, is the most promising one for reaching the normative goal of civic education: Politically self-determined citizens. © JSSE 2014.

AB  - Health research shows that knowing about health risks may not translate into behavior change. However, such research typically operationalizes health information acquisition with knowledge tests. Information scientists who investigate socially embedded information behaviors could help improve understanding of potential associations between information behavior-as opposed to knowledge-and health behavior formation, thus providing new opportunities to investigate the effects of health information. We examine the associations between information behavior and HIV testing intentions among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), a group with high rates of unrecognized HIV infection. We used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict intentions to seek HIV testing in an online sample of 163 YMSM. Multiple regression and recursive path analysis were used to test two models: (a) the basic TPB model and (b) an adapted model that added the direct effects of three information behaviors (information exposure, use of information to make HIV-testing decisions, prior experience obtaining an HIV test) plus self-rated HIV knowledge. As hypothesized, our adapted model improved predictions, explaining more than twice as much variance as the original TPB model. The results suggest that information behaviors may be more important predictors of health behavior intentions than previously acknowledged. © 2014 ASIS&T.

AB  - To meet their informationa needs, people use different tools and technologies which are called the individuals' information grounds. However, the literature on information grounds is limited to the United States; and there is no research comparing the information grounds of students in Iran so far. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the information grounds of students in Payame Noor University of Kermanshah. The total population of full-time students in Kermanshah Payame Noor University at the time of this study was about 6000. Using stratified random sampling technique, 361 students were selected to participate in this survey. A questionnaire survey was used to carry out the study. Findings revealed that the most common information grounds used were as follows: house of friends and relatives, university campus, and bus service. Also, the main reasons for using these information grounds are: presence of expert individuals, relaxed grounds, ease of communication with people in the ground, and enhancing the scope of personal knowledge and experience by exchanging information in that ground. The results indicated that there was a significant correlation between the socioeconomic status of students and type of information grounds. Moreover, it was found that there was a significant difference in male and female students' views regarding the reasons for using such grounds.

AB  - Differences are identified between the preferred information and learning channels of small and medium-sized tourism enterprise (SMTE) proprietors, who have an interest in business operations (growers) or who have relatively less interest (lifestylers). Lifestylers sign up frequently to tourism industry associations, whereas growers have a tendency to join generic business groupings. The most common information for both groups is marketing related, and intensive use is made of online information to support day-to-day business operations. In aggregate, SMTE proprietors are avid information seekers, attaching importance to the advice provided from experienced and trusted sources. Growers proactively gather information about general management as well as tourism-specific knowledge. Adopting a 'one size fits all' approach to providing information for the SMTE sector is unlikely to be effective. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper explores how a foreign language librarian investigated workplace information environments of bilingual (Spanish/English) professionals in the United States in order to design more relevant information literacy (IL) instruction. Drawing from interviews and participant observations of professionals whose careers correspond with Spanish language student graduate opportunities, the primary goal of the paper is to provide an initial understanding of the information environments of professionals in bilingual workplaces. The paper will then describe how this data will be used to design appropriate learning opportunities for Spanish undergraduates. Through reflecting on these multilingual information experiences, the paper also considers the role of workplace IL within higher education as well as contributing more broadly to studies on cultural approaches to IL. Accordingly, this paper will be of interest to foreign language librarians, as well as librarians who work with global studies, international relations or bilingual and international populations.

AB  - Nations have made great strides in providing physical access to digital technologies and educational opportunities, yet barriers still exist that prevent those who have strong physical and intellectual access to information and communication technology from taking full advantage of the information and opportunities the technology offers. Women in particular are affected by social barriers which may be quite subtle and are easily excluded from taking an active role in the information society. This study explores how Indian women incorporate information and communication technology (ICT) into their daily lives and what aids or barriers they face in the process. This study contributes to an understanding of factors that lead to Indian women's current use of ICT, reasons why Indian women choose to use ICT, and barriers to this usage.

AB  - This study investigated the self-efficacy perceptions of Israeli library and information science students regarding their information seeking behavior. That is, it examined the judgments that participants make of their searching abilities. The study was based on Bandura's four sources of self-efficacy information: past performance or mastery experiences, vicarious experiences of observing the experiences of others, social feedback and affective states. An online survey presenting the Information Seeking Self-Perception Scale (IRSPS) was distributed and 205 students completed the questionnaire anonymously. Findings show that participants reported a high level of self-efficacy and that three of the four sources of self-efficacy information were significant in constructing their self-efficacy beliefs. Correlations between self-efficacy percepts and several socio-demographic variables revealed no gender-based differences. A significant correlation was found between age and degree and the sources with more influence. Older postgraduate students reported being more impacted by their mastery experiences, their affective states and social feedback. The implementation of the Information Seeking Self-Perception Scale (IRSPS) can be valuable when designing and implementing LIS academic programs for different groups of students. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: A previous contribution argues in favour of a balance in emphasis between information communication technology (ICT); information retrieval systems (IRS) such as databases, library catalogues, repositories, Google Scholar, digital libraries, portals, search engines; and the users of these systems. This contribution aims to pursue the need to consider affect and an affective paradigm more prominently in the design, evaluation, promotion and use of IRS and library and information services (LIS). Design/methodology/approach: The contribution is written against the background of research in information behaviour, user studies, systems design, and information literacy. Findings: Although the literature from LIS and other disciplines notes an affective paradigm or even paradigms, it is not strongly positioned compared with the systems and cognitive paradigms. A growing body of research and work practices such as information representation and tagging, and information skills training, is taking a slant towards affect and emotion. The question, however, is whether current work is sufficient to argue for an affective paradigm complementary to the systems, cognitive and socio-cognitive paradigms, and how an affective paradigm should be introduced in training/education for LIS. Originality/value: Although there are a number of publications on affect and emotion, and references to an affective paradigm, this contribution is aimed at stimulating thought on whether we should prominently introduce the affective paradigm into LIS curricula as preparation for adding more value to IRS, library services, and in dealing with emotion-laden jobs, and if so, how. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the role of representational artefacts in sensemaking. Embodied within representational media, such as maps, charts and lists, are a number of affordances, which can furnish sensemakers with the ability to perform tasks that may be difficult to do inside the head. Presented here is a study of sensemaking in action. We conducted a study of military intelligence analysts carrying out a training exercise, the analysis of which focuses on the use of external task-specific representations. We present a discussion of the findings of our study in the form of a model of distributed sensemaking. Our model concentrates on the interaction of information and various representational artefacts, leading to the generation of insights and a situation picture. We also introduce a number of levels of description for examining the properties and affordances offered by representational artefacts and their role in the sensemaking process. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to seek to ascertain the corporate social responsibility (CSR) information needs of customers of microfinance institutions (MFIs). It also ascertains their media preferences for CSR disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The study adapted Wilson’s (1981) concept of information needs as the conceptual basis of this study. Case study research design was used. The respondents consisted of customers of MFIs in Ghana. Semi-structured interview was used to collect the data. Data were analysed using thematic analysis technique. Findings: The study found that the CSR information needs of MFIs’ customers relate to moral disclosure, business survival disclosure, financial and business terms and conditions disclosure, donations disclosure and capacity building and training disclosure. The study also found that family and friends are the most reliable sources of CSR information for MFIs’ customers. Originality/value: There is a great deal of literature available on CSR disclosure. However, limited studies have investigated the information needs of customers regarding CSR disclosure. Again, CSR disclosure in the Microfinance sector has received limited attention in the existing literature. This study expanded the existing literature by investigating the CSR information needs of MFIs’ customers. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to examine the information behavior of diabetic patients, a relatively unexplored field of diabetes care, including their needs for information, resources used, obstacles encountered and degree of satisfaction for diabetes-related information acquisition. Methods:203 patients (males:110, type 2:172) followed-up in the outpatient Diabetes Clinics of a University-affiliated hospital in Greece were assessed, using a validated questionnaire. Results: Patients identified diet (61.4%) and diabetic complications (41.9%) as "the most important" for their information needs and the treating physician (94.6%) for information resources. Internet importance and frequency of use ranked low. Main obstacles to information seeking were "lack of time" and "cost". Most patients (71.4%) stated they were "quite" or "very satisfied" with the current possibilities of information seeking. Conclusions: Diabetic patients' stated information needs and information sources, as well as main obstacles to obtaining information could potentially have important implications in designing a future information campaign. © 2015 Kalantzi et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - As online social networking sites (SNS) are becoming a part of many people's daily life, they have become a topic of interest that attracts the attention of both academics and practitioners. The users' behaviours on those sites are complex and have important implications. Individuals can use a wide range of SNS's functionalities, for example, to socialise and promote their online identities or find friends of common interests. Reckless online behaviours on SNS have been shown to result in breaches of privacy and other risks such as cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking, and job loss. As a result, there are many concerns over these problems that prevent SNS from reaching their full potential. Given the vast number of user's concerns, identified by prior studies, there is a need to explore a typology of users that classifies online personas. This typology would reveal more about the users' needs and help improve their experience on SNS. To achieve that goal, we collected data from fourteen Vietnamese young adults of different backgrounds who use Facebook, which was then analysed with Q factor analysis. The findings suggested three distinctive online personas that include the Outgoing Connector, the Reserved Trustor, and the Threats Perceiver. Implications for marketing tactics and design of better users' experiences on social networking sites were discussed, and the proposed typology could serve as a starting point for future research to further explore the different types of social media's users. © 2015 Dang-Pham, Pittayachawan & Nkhoma.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discover the research practices of biology researchers and to assess the suitability of the OJAX++ Virtual Research Environment (VRE) for these researchers. Design/methodology/approach: Usability testing was used to evaluate the usability of OJAX++ in relation to biology researchers. Interviews with biology researchers in a large Irish university were conducted to investigate their research information behaviour, to establish user requirements in their discipline and to evaluate the feasibility of using OJAX++ in their research. Findings: The results show that biology researchers used online tools extensively in their research but do not use social networking tools. E-mail and phone conversations are the preferred methods of collaborating with colleagues. The biology researchers found that OJAX++ was easy to use, intuitive and professionally presented but in its present format, OJAX++ does not fit in with current research practices as they do not use Web 2.0 tools that facilitate tagging. A list of requirements of a VRE for biology researchers is presented. Originality/value: The findings of the study will assist developers of VREs and other web tools to better understand how researchers, in particular biologists, collaborate during the research process and what they require from online research tools. This study gives an important insight into the information behaviour of life science researchers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - As more individuals turn to social network sites (SNSs) for information, the spread of misinformation in these sites is becoming a greater concern. Not only can misinformation cause individual users anxiety and harm, but it can also prevent SNSs from realizing their full potential as trustworthy sources of information. This study proposed and tested an intervention-based strategy that was designed to discourage behavior that promotes the spread of misinformation. Guided by the social cognitive theory (SCT), the intervention sought to modify users' outcome expectations by presenting them with a message that highlighted the negative consequences of misinformation. To investigate the effectiveness of this intervention message, a classical experiment was conducted on-line with 131 college-student participants. In the study's experimental group, the ANOVA results showed that the intervention effectively reduced the total number of “Likes” and “Shares” for postings that provided misinformation. Future development and testing of this SCT-guided, outcome-expectations-based intervention is promising. Copyright © 2015 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - This study measured information seeking anxiety among postgraduate students of the University of the Punjab, Lahore. Survey method using questionnaire was employed to conduct this investigation. The questionnaire consisting of an Information Seeking Anxiety Scale and demographic variables was administered in students, selected through convenient sampling procedure, for data collection. The results indicated that a large majority (n=207, 82.4%) of the respondents experienced more than low anxiety in the information seeking process. No significant relationship was found between age, gender, faculty and information seeing anxiety scores of these students. Conversely, there were significant differences in anxiety scores of students based on the program of study, stage of study, and computer proficiency. The results provide useful insights for guidance of information professionals dealing with reference and research services, especially those engaged in designing information literacy curricula and managing information literacy instructions. © 2016, University of the Punjab.

AB  - This paper explores, on the basis of their cognitive states, the likely inclinations of a group of young people in England with regard to evaluating Web-based information. The work draws on data submitted via an online questionnaire by 82 16–18 year-olds. Frequency counts were generated and each participant received a ‘trust disposition’ score according to their questionnaire responses. The results present a mixed picture in terms of the probable tendencies of young people to evaluate information. The participants’ data in relation to some of the issues addressed in the questionnaire suggest that they may be inclined to accept much of what they see without challenging it, although few of their overall trust disposition scores are significantly high. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - An examination of the information behaviour of distance learning students is described, based on a case study of the International Programmes of the University of London. A comprehensive literature analysis, and comparison of relevant information behaviour models were carried out, supported by a survey of student behaviour. Following a pilot study, the main survey gained responses from 649 students, in 81 countries and following diverse study programmes. A variety of inter-related factors were found to influence information behaviour, level and subject of study being most significant. Ease and speed of access, and familiarity of sources were predominant factors. An extension of Wilson's information behaviour model is proposed to cater for the specific features of the distance learning context. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to describe the information-seeking pattern of primary care doctors and to examine the present position of clinical information availability at remote government health facilities in the District of Multan, Punjab, Pakistan. The participants of this study were all the medical officers working in Basic Health Units (BHUs), Rural Health Centers (RHCs) and Tehsil Headquarters (THQs), as these doctors met the established criteria. Criteria included Health Facilities run under Executive District Officer (EDO) Health, Multan. A descriptive survey was conducted for data collection. A close ended questionnaire was developed after relevant literature review and also accessing the situation of the remote government health facilities in district Multan. Results of this study showed that doctors rarely have the access to the services of medical librarian and medical library. Seventy four (74%) respondents have no access to computer with an internet although the print format is the most preferred format for seeking clinical information among primary care doctors. The study summarized that doctor's information seeking encountered barriers such as non availability of medical librarian, medical library that hindered the fulfillment of information needs. © 2013 University of Idaho Library.

AB  - This study investigated the information needs of cotton growers residing in two villages in the district of Bahawalpur. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by visiting farms or homes using a semi-structured interview schedule. Data were analyzed by applying descriptive statistics. The results indicated that cotton growers required information, in general, in the areas of soil management and plot preparation, cotton seeds, crop care, and pre- and post- harvesting activities. Moreover, these farmers relied very much upon informal networks (progressive farmers, sales agents, and pesticides dealers) while looking for the needed information. Lack of timely access, illiteracy, infrequent visits of extension staff, and language barrier were the major problems that these farmers faced while getting needed information. The results of this research indicated the need for an integrated agricultural information delivery system for farmers. This research has made a significant contribution in cotton growers’ information behavior research. © 2015, University of the Punjab. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the ways adolescents create information collaboratively in the digital environment. In spite of the current widespread practice of information creation by young people, little research exists to illuminate how youth are engaged in creative information behavior or how they make participatory contributions to the changing information world. The purposefully selected sample includes teenagers who actively produce and share information projects, such as online school magazines, an information-sharing website in Wiki, and a digital media library, using Scratch - a graphical programming language developed by MIT Media Lab. Qualitative data were collected through group and individual interviews informed by Dervin's Sense-Making Methodology. The data analysis technique included directed qualitative content analysis with Atlas.ti. Findings reveal the process of information creation, including content development, organization, and presentation of information, as well as noticeable patterns by youth such as visualizing, remixing, tinkering, and gaining a sense of empowerment. This study extends our knowledge of the creative aspects of information behavior. © 2013 ASIS&T.

AB  - The aims of this paper are to provide insight into the information behaviour (IB) of people seeking information related to activities carried out in the virtual world (VW) Second Life (SL) and to identify whether IB models derived from contexts other than VWs are also applicable to SL. Ninety-one interviews, each describing an incident when the interviewee needed information for an SL activity, were carried out in SL itself. Data was analysed using existing research models of IB and inductively. It was established that models of IB derived in real-world settings are also applicable in VWs, and the models are enriched with new SL examples. Information encountering emerged as a dominant mode of information discovery, but behaviours such as browsing, monitoring, purposive search and verifying were also identified. Seven categories of need and four major categories of outcome emerged from inductive analysis of the data. A wide variety of sources were used by the participants and a new term, blended IB, is proposed to describe this varied IB. This study contributes insights into the everyday and practice-based IB of academics and professionals that is lacking in the literature. It can also provide guidance for those supporting information-seeking across new digital channels. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - International migration is a worldwide phenomenon. However, the process of immigrants' settlement is still considered an under-researched area from an information perspective. Navigating information throughout the settlement process is considered challenging but critical for immigrants. The uptake of information is deemed significant to both the well-being of immigrants and their host countries. An important outcome of the capability to navigate information in a new landscape is increasing the likelihood of social inclusion in a new country. More empirical research is needed to identify the characteristics of immigrants' information behaviour in the context of their settlement. This paper provides an overview of immigrants' information behaviour studies and the use of public library services by immigrants and identifies gaps in the literature. Supported and tested by a pilot study, a conceptual framework is developed to underpin a study into Asian immigrants' information behaviour in South Australia, linking their information needs, information seeking, information grounds and information sharing, and corresponding public library services to their ongoing settlement. © 2015 Australian Library & Information Association.

AB  - This paper presents the findings from an online survey investigating how new students seek geospatial information in an unfamiliar environment. By surveying 149 new graduate students at University of Maryland, College Park, this study identifies the geospatial information needs and information sources used during their adjustment in new environments, and examines the factors that may affect different geospatial information behaviors (GIBs) of new students, such as populousness of students’ countries of origin on campus, gender, age, and program level (Master's, PhD). Findings include (1) international students’ greater emphases on survival-related geospatial information; (2) gender differences in the importance of navigational and transportation information and frequency of using navigational information sources during adjustment; (3) significant differences among socio-national and demographic groups for geospatial information needs and for the use of information sources. The findings are discussed in ways to further our understanding of new students’ GIB in unfamiliar environments and inform further research in human information behavior.

AB  - The study of information-seeking behaviors takes on particular importance when considered within the health context, where the process of information seeking can save lives. When individuals implement preventative health-care behaviors in the present, they increase the probability of saving their own lives in the future. However, the benefits of preventative health-care behaviors are irrelevant when the public is unaware of such information. Current literature indicates that there are two types of information behavior: active and passive. Active information behavior involves intentional physical behaviors, while passive is comprised of strictly psychological, sometimes unintentional, processes. The following article reports the initial validity portfolio for measures of both active and passive information behavior. © 2014 Copyright Eastern Communication Association.

AB  - There is increasing interest in topics at the nexus of collaboration and information behavior. A variety of studies conducted in organizational settings have provided us with key insights about the collaborative aspects of seeking, retrieving, and using information. Researchers have used a range of terms, including collaborative information seeking (CIS), collaborative information retrieval (CIR), collaborative search, collaborative sensemaking, and others to describe various pertinent activities. Consequently, we lack conceptual clarity concerning these activities, leading to a tendency to use terms interchangeably when in fact they may be referring to different issues. Here, we offer collaborative information behavior (CIB) as an umbrella term to connote the collaborative aspects of information seeking, retrieval, and use. We provide the contours of a model of CIB synthesized from findings of past studies conducted by our research team as well as other researchers. By reanalyzing and synthesizing the data from those studies, we conceptualize CIB as comprised of a set of constitutive activities, organized into three broad phases - problem formulation, collaborative information seeking, and information use. Some of the activities are specific to a particular phase, whereas others are common to all phases. We explain how those constitutive activities are related to one another. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our model as well as its potential usefulness in advancing CIB research. © 2013 ASIS&T.

AB  - Purpose - The authors wanted to provide an enriched understanding of how lawyers keep up-to-date with legal developments. Maintaining awareness of developments in an area (known as "monitoring") is an important aspect of professional's information work. This is particularly true for lawyers, who are expected to keep up-to-date with legal developments on an ongoing basis. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with a group of lawyers who authored and published current awareness content for LexisNexis - a large publishing organisation. The interviews focused on identifying the types of electronic, printed and people-based current awareness resources the lawyers used to keep up-to-date with legal developments and the reasons for their choices. Findings - The lawyers mostly used electronic resources (particularly e-mail alerts and an electronic tool that alerted them to changes in website content), alongside interpersonal sources, such as colleagues, customers and professional contacts. Printed media, such as journals and newspapers, were used more rarely and usually to complement electronic and person-based resources. A number of factors were found to influence choice. These included situational relevance, presentation, utility and trustworthiness, the speed of content acquisition and interpretation facilitated by the resource. Originality/value - The authors' findings enrich their understanding of lawyers' monitoring behaviour, which has so far received little direct research attention. Their design suggestions have the potential to feed into the design of new and improvement of existing digital current awareness resources. Their findings have the potential to act as "success criteria" by which these resources can be evaluated from a user-centred perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical discussion on the nature of research into people’s information behaviour, and in particular the contribution of the phenomenological approach for the development of information solutions.; Design/methodology/approach-The approach takes the form of a conceptual analysis drawing on the research literature and personal research experience. Findings-The paper brings to the foreground the relative value of different conceptual approaches and how these underpin and relate to the development of information solutions.; Research limitations/implications-The paper, due to the breadth and complexity of the subject, serves to highlight key issues and bringing together ideas. Some topics deserve further explanation. However, this was beyond the scope of this paper.; Practical implications-A conceptual framework is provided that indicates the value of the epistemic spectrum for information behaviour studies and provides support for action research and participative design.; Social implications-Taking a phenomenological approach, and consequently either a first person approach and/or a highly participative approach to research, challenges the relationship between researcher and respondent. It also raises questions about why the authors conduct research and for whom it is intended.; Originality/value-The paper makes explicit the underlying philosophical assumptions and how these ideas influence the way the authors conduct research; it highlights the significance of Cartesian dualism and indicates the significance of these assumptions for the development of information solutions. It supports the view that researchers and developers should be open to respondents leading the exploration of their needs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Interrelation of models and theories of human information behaviour (HIB), their common roots, and the extent to which they are indebted to the fields other than library and information science (LIS) were investigated. Fifty-one theories were selected and their bibliographic information was obtained from Web of Science and then citation analysis and bibliographic coupling analysis were performed. Pajek, HistCite, Sci2 Tool and VOSViewer software were used for analysis and visualization. The results showed that most of the theories were proposed by information scientists. A fewof the theories were proposed by scientists from the fields of sociology, psychology, computer science and a few other disciplines. Citation analysis showed that LIS literature has been used extensively in HIB theories; however, there were also citations to the sources of 29 other fields especially to sociology, communication, psychology, management, educational science and computer science. This is an indication of the interdisciplinary nature of HIB domain. Bibliographic coupling map showed that about four fifths of the theories were linked to each other as a whole network. The development of a large number of theories within the field of LIS is an indication for the increasing maturity of the interdisciplinary research area of HIB as well as the maturity of LIS field. © 2013, Hamid R.

AB  - The process of information- and inspiration-seeking behaviour amongst artists and designers often involve direct observation, note-taking, collecting materials and image samples, recognising styles, analysing movements, patterns, textures, as well as experimenting with different materials and techniques. They also rely heavily on having access to a variety of visual resources, both physical and digital, during the process of inspiration-seeking. However, there have been few studies on how art and design students look for and use information in the digital age, especially in the context of the library. This paper reports on an empirical study of the inspiration-seeking process and other information-related behaviour of students at the Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI). An online questionnaire was created to ask the HKDI students specific questions: the types of library preferred; students' comfort level with the HKDI Library; student respondents' information needs; and their preferred sources for inspiration. They were also asked which media and venues they looked to for information that was important to their creative process. A total of 327 current students at the HKDI completed the survey. The research findings suggest that information-seeking behaviour of the art and design students was reflective of the fluid and creative nature of the art and design domain. They were regular users of traditional printed resources as well as the physical libraries. They also placed heavy reliance on the Internet and a variety of social networks when it came to inspiration-seeking. Inspiration was found from a very diverse and ‘idiosyncratic’ set of sources; often via accidental discovery. The students' status as emergent practitioners also suggested a strong need for career advice and interactions with peers practicing in the art and design field. © 2015 Australian Library & Information Association.

AB  - Purpose – This study investigated the application in the field of healthcare of a recently developed model of information seeking and communication. The purpose of this paper is to test the model’s validity and to identify insights that it may provide. Design/methodology/approach – To investigate the model’s application to information users, the findings from published literature on physicians’ information behaviour were studied. To investigate its application to information providers, interviews were carried out with staff working for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and with employees of pharmaceutical companies. The findings were examined using deductive content analysis. Findings – The findings endorse the validity of the model, with minor modifications. The model provides practical insights into the behaviour of both users and providers of information and the factors that influence them. It can be used to identify ways in which information behaviour may be positively modified in both finding and communicating healthcare information. Originality/value – This research demonstrates the practical value of a new model of information behaviour which was developed using insights from earlier models. In doing so it answers criticisms that research in library and information science often fails to build on previous research and that it has little practical usefulness. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Digital inclusion research has focused overwhelmingly on access to information. But access to information by itself is of limited value unless the intended beneficiary has the capacity to use it. It is the use of information that delivers the benefits. However, in information and communication technologies for development literature, there is little empirical work on the process by which use of information delivers benefits. This study fills the gap by studying information use by poor female mobile phone users in rural India. It identifies six stages in the information use process and models them. © 2015, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study is to gain a clearer understanding of the lived information-seeking experiences of mature students. Such a study is relevant to researchers seeking detailed examinations of mature students' information search experiences, as well as to reference librarians and information literacy instructors who may wish to refine pedagogy or curriculum in order to help mature students more effectively. This study employed a narrative inquiry design to deeply explore the semester-long information search journeys of two mature students at a regional public university in the state of Oklahoma. Narrative analysis utilizing Carol Kuhlthau's (1991; 1993; 2004; Kuhlthau et al 2008) information search process model uncovered key themes of passion for a topic, time management, the influence of other academic and personal factors on students' search experiences, and willingness to ask formal or informal search mediators for help. These themes have implications for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and positively transform the information-seeking process of mature students.

AB  - Information seeking in the workplace can vary substantially from one search to the next due to changes in the context of the search. Modeling these dynamic contextual effects is an important challenge facing the research community because it has the potential to lead to more responsive search systems. With this motivation, a study of software engineers was conducted to understand the role that contextual factors play in shaping their information-seeking behavior. Research was conducted in the field in a large technology company and comprised six unstructured interviews, a focus group, and 13 in-depth, semistructured interviews. Qualitative analysis revealed a set of contextual factors and related information behaviors. Results are formalized in the contextual model of source selection, the main contributions of which are the identification of two types of conditioning variables (requirements and constraints) that mediate between the contextual factors and source-selection decisions, and the articulation of dominant source-selection patterns. The study has implications for the design of context-sensitive search systems in this domain and may inform contextual approaches to information seeking in other professional domains. © 2014 ASIS&T.

AB  - Academics are increasingly being asked to demonstrate the impact of their research beyond the walls of the academy. Societal impact measures were introduced as part of the Research Excellence Framework exercise in the UK in 2014 with a number of other countries, including Australia, considering similar assessments. As societal impact measures continue to proliferate there will be significant implications for academics, institutions, and academic libraries to document and support these activities. Information science is well-placed not only to guide practical supports within our institutions, but also to develop metrics and qualitative approaches to assess this type of research impact. This exploratory qualitative study — situated in a constructivist grounded theory methodology — investigated academics’ experiences and perceptions of the concept of societal research impact and the supports needed to facilitate this work. The definition of impact varied greatly among participants, but regardless of the participant's conception, interviewees felt that they were not prepared, trained, or had access to the needed supports to adequately document non-academic types of impact. The data point to a number of emergent themes including a lack of relevant methodologies for tracking societal impact, the shortcomings of metrics approaches to document impact outside of academe, and the need for academic libraries to extend current reference and training supports to provide researchers with the tools and skills needed in this new impact landscape. Implications for research and development in information science related to scholarly communication, researchers’ information behaviors, and impact measures are also explored.

AB  - In spite of often compelling reasons for why people should seek information, they persistently engage in lower levels of it than might be expected, at times seeking no information at all. The idealized model reflecting dogged persistence, pursuing rational search strategies, until a high-quality answer is found is often assumed in the design of information systems. However, many people confronted with health problems engage in avoidance and denial, making a health care system dependent on proactivity problematic. This essay explores six conditions, the idealized model, avoidance, bewilderment, serendipity, ignorance is bliss, and indolence, that arise from low and high effort strategies when typed by good, contingent, and bad health outcomes. Since a substantial proportion of the population does not act in accordance with our assumptions, it may be time for policy makers, system designers and researchers to revisit their approaches to facilitating health-related information seeking. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - When patients need information, they may visit a doctor, ask a nurse, or look online. But these are not the only sources of information used by patients. This paper examines discussion threads in online renal support groups to describe how people living with kidney failure conceive of help, information and support. I use Actor Network Theory to locate unexpected sources of information and authority such as information obtained from lived experiences, from bodies or from the machinery used to maintain health. By virtue of being embedded in networks of interrelating elements, the patient emerged as a potential information locus: potentially able to confirm information such as medical measurements, make measurements themselves, generate information related to their own sensations, and summarise information about the trajectory of their illness. Implications for practice include an expanded conception of health information literacy for patients, and expanded possibilities for health information service provision. © 2013 Australian Library & Information Association.

AB  - The preservation of ergodic digital artifacts, such as videogames, is a complex and uncertain archival task. This study examines how fan fiction metadata can facilitate the preservation of digital experiences. Based on a preliminary assessment of fan fiction associated with the videogame Mass Effect, collections of fan fiction metadata constitute a promising resource to identify and document player experiences, particularly those involving game characters and their relationships.

AB  - Background: Internet use became an integral part of the healthcare relationship. Literature indicates that the illness trajectory plays a role in the use of Internet as a health information tool. This study focuses on infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. Aim: This study aims to understand how the illness trajectory triggers the use of Internet by parents of infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, using a conceptual framework influenced by Corbin and Strauss' illness trajectory. Design: This study was based on a qualitative longitudinal multiple-case study design. Methods: From July 2007-August 2008 and from June 2009-May 2010, parents with newborns were prospectively interviewed over a period of 10 months. Parents were recruited in four neonatal intensive care units. The interviews were subject of a thematic content analysis. Results: The multi-layered illness trajectory triggers Internet use. Parents' online health information behaviour interacts with other information channels too (such as interaction with healthcare professionals). Parents accumulate knowledge along the illness trajectory affecting their information needs. The sickness trajectory helps to understand the complexity of the information behaviour. Labels have a major impact on the effectiveness of search strategies. Conclusions: Nursing and other healthcare professionals should become more aware about the complex relationship between information needs and Internet use along the illness trajectory of an infant. As such, they will be more able to assist parents in finding and evaluating high-quality online information at the right time. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical discussion of the paucity of research on information behaviour of information providers and to propose a framework for investigating the emerging area of provider information behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: The approach takes the form of a conceptual analysis and literature review. Findings: A multidisciplinary framework is provided to form the basis of further exploration of provider information behaviour. Research limitations/implications: There are various types of information providers and they provide opportunities for exploring and comparing their range of information activities and developing models of provider information behaviour. Originality/value: The paper argues for a new perspective to the study of information behaviour. The paucity of research on internal users of information has not matched those on external users of information over the years. An exploration of provider information behaviour together with its internal impact can provide insights which will help organisations better understand best practice, predict effects of new behaviours during periods of change and make informed decisions. It will also aid in the development of the teaching of information and library skills. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In crises and disasters, social media not only facilitates mobilization, sharing of critical information, but also enables people to watch and participate as the crisis unfolds. Participation is now much more open to those beyond the immediately affected: the victims, the rescue workers and other stakeholders. This paper reports on a study of tweets collected during and after a rare occurrence of a violent riot in Singapore, illustrating the evolution of crisis responses, emotive cues information seeking and sharing behavior on Twitter over the lifecycle of the riot. Evidence of orientation of responses from the self towards the community as the riot progresses was found, contributing to ongoing research on community building in crises. Emotive cues were most dominant in the first hour of the riot, with various responses fluctuating over the riot's lifecycle. Emotive cues predicted most responses except for tweets that were reasoning about the riot, and also had an effect on informational tweets. Retweets drove most activity, and users also shared information and formed communal dialogue within their own networks. Despite the dominance of negative emotive cues and responses to the crisis, positive tweets - those singing praises and thanking stakeholders - were more likely to be retweeted. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research investigates information behaviour of the strategic and tactical level commanders' in emergency response context. The objective of the research is to observe and analyse the information processing of the emergency staff while carrying out complex, time critical tasks in emergency settings. Task studies in the recent literature discuss laboratory cases; this research has originality in investigating the real phenomenon. Fieldwork was conducted in AKOM (Afet Kordinasyon Merkezi - Disaster Coordination Centre) and Istanbul Fire Brigade settings. Data was collected via qualitative methods such as interviews and field observations. Emergency response tasks were analysed and categorised using Byström and Jarvelin's (1995) conceptual framework. Cultural Historical Activity Theory is used as a theoretical framework and conceptual data analysis tool. Leont'ev (1978) and Wilson's (2006b, 2008) activity system hierarchical structure was used to deconstruct tasks and scrutinise subtasks that has supporting role in emergency response context. Findings reveal that time pressure and task complexity has significant role on emergency response decision tasks and the way of responders' information processing. To hedge uncertainty and make effective timely decisions, tactical and strategic level commanders collaboratively share information using abstract and concrete tools such as ICT, language, mobile devices and radio. As practical implications, the results of this research shed lights onto redesign of ICT tools used during disaster times, and restructuring the disaster management organisations to facilitate effective knot working while emergency response.

AB  - A key element in the adoption of innovation is addressing the knowledge gap caused by its introduction in practice. This study examines the context in which information is searched, found and retrieved, reviewing previous related research work, especially in the area of cognitive information retrieval. As result of an extensive review of research literature on the adoption of online learning design systems in education and on information behaviour, the study proposes a social adoption of innovation model, which includes information systems and social networks, and features innovators and adopters of innovation that influence each other and participate simultaneously in the process of knowledge generation. The study also proposes two symbolic equations for general knowledge behaviour and general information seeking skills that reflect the contribution of multiple sources of information and the type of skills that are needed as part of the overall knowledge behaviour. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study explores the effect of color of book cover and typeface of title and author name on human gaze behavior while browsing bookshelves. An eye-tracking experiment was performed with 23 participants, using a wearable eye-tracker and 96 books. The difference of gaze duration time and the number of book subjects chosen was analyzed in two categories: between warm color book covers and cold color ones, and between Ming-style typeface and Gothic typeface. Results showed no effect of book cover color on gaze duration and user choice. However, typeface of book title and author name had an effect. It was revealed that Gothic typeface was more attractive if book titles had meaning. Copyright © 2016 by Association for Information Science and Technology

AB  - This research examined the information behavior of parents (including legal guardians) during an emergent health situation with a child. Although many studies examine health-related information behaviors, very few explore health consumers' information practices during moments of health crisis. This study explored parents' information needs, source use, and source preferences during a visit to the emergency department. An online questionnaire was administered using iPads given to 897 parents with children at one of 32 participating general emergency departments (ED) across Canada. Before taking their child to the ED, only 38.8% (n=348) of parents looked for information; those who did search looked most frequently for information about specific symptoms or severity of illness. Prior to visiting the ED the sources most frequently accessed were the internet and direct contact with healthcare professionals. At the emergency department, parents' information needs centred on immediate concerns, including explanations of their child's illness, treatments, and care instructions. Household income, education level, and parents' age were factors that affected information seeking in emergent health situations. Overwhelmingly, speaking to a healthcare professional in person is the typical and preferred way to obtain health information when facing a health crisis involving a child. The results have implications for how and when healthcare information is shared; the findings add to the limited research on parents' information behavior, particularly their roles as information proxies for their children.

AB  - In this paper we explored three areas: decision making and information seeking, the relationship between information seeking and uncertainty, and the role of expertise in influencing information use. This was undertaken in the context of a qualitative study into decision making in the initial stages of emergency response to major incidents. The research took an interpretive approach in which activity theory is used as an analytical framework. The research provides further evidence that the context of the activity and individual differences influence the choice of decision mode and associated information behavior. We also established that information is often not used to resolve uncertainty in decision making and indeed information is often sought and used after the decision is made to justify the decision. Finally, we point to the significance of both expertise and confidence in understanding information behavior. The contribution of the research to existing theoretical frameworks is discussed and a modified version of Wilson's problem-solving model is proposed. © 2014 ASIS&T.

AB  - It is argued that notwithstanding the life expectation of patients in palliative care, they still grapple with a wide spectrum of uncertainties for which they require answers to bring relief from anxiety. Nurses, appreciative of their role to relief anxiety, are often the only persons with whom patients have regular contact that can assist them in finding answers. Although nursing staff are well trained in palliative care, they often experience frustration when they fail to access the right information that will provide their patients' information needs. Despite evidence of numerous successful information provision interventions by nursing staff, the literature continues to report unmet information needs and frustrations of patients and their families. As a solution, this paper offers an exploratory conceptualisation of nurses and palliative care which can serve as a framework for further investigations towards enhancing nursing staff's information intermediary capacity.

AB  - Information use intrigues information behavior researchers, though many have struggled with how to conceptualize and study this phenomenon. Some work suggests that information may have social uses, hinting that information use is more complicated than previous frameworks suggest. Therefore, we use a micro-sociological, symbolic interactionist approach to examine the use of one type of information - biomedical information - in the everyday life interactions of chronic illness patients and their families. Based on a grounded theory analysis of 60 semi-structured interviews (30 individual patient interviews and 30 family group interviews) and observations within the family group interviews, we identify 4 categories of information use: (a) knowing my body; (b) mapping the social terrain; (c) asserting autonomy; and (d) puffing myself up. Extending previous research, the findings demonstrate use of biomedical information in interactions that construct a valued self for the patient: a person who holds authority, and who is unique and cared for. In so doing, we contribute novel insights regarding the use of information to manage social emotions such as shame, and to construct embodied knowledge that is mobilized in action to address disease-related challenges. We thus offer an expanded conceptualization of information use that provides new directions for research and practice. © 2014 ASIS&T.

AB  - The data landscape study at Virginia Tech addresses the changing modes of faculty scholarship increasingly driven by data and supports the development of a user-centric data infrastructure, management, and curation system. The study investigates faculty researchers’ current practices in organizing, describing, sharing, reusing, and preserving data and the emerging needs for data services and education. The results determine the different dimensions of data-related activities, challenges, and opportunities and the changing nature of faculty demands regarding data documentation, storage, and archiving. Asking faculty researchers to self-reflect data sharing and reuse from both data producers’ and data users’ perspectives, the study reveals a significant gap between the rather localized and sporadic data management and sharing activities and the highly perceived reuse values of data that often get lost right after the original work is done. With expertise in data, information, and archive fields, libraries have great values to offer in bridging the gap and building a data-driven, shared-access research enterprise.

AB  - We designed a questionnaire based on findings from economics and psychology, enabling us to simultaneously investigate a broad range of motives that presumably constitute the reluctance to buy annuities. To address the interdependence of financial product choice and domain-specific investor sophistication, we construct and employ a novel, comprehensive measure of "annuity literacy". The results from a representative survey among German consumers reveal that both established rational and so far untested behavioral motives are significant barriers to annuitize wealth. Furthermore, the overall level of annuity literacy is rather low, with most respondents lacking knowledge of an annuity's core mechanics. These findings disclose promising directions for annuity suppliers, policy makers, and researchers towards resolving the annuity puzzle. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, researchers observed student study behaviors in the libraries of four post-secondary institutions. In all, 2,773 observations were made. This research replicates and expands an earlier study and addresses its limitations. The results of a logistic regression test indicate whether students had a mobile device readily available and where students chose to study in the library best predicted whether they demonstrated a study, as opposed to a non-study, behavior. Specifically, if students were found in quiet study or computer areas, they were more likely to be performing study behaviors. This research has implications for library stakeholders making decisions about the use of library space. Most importantly, this research demonstrates that library spaces are widely used for diverse purposes. © , Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The purpose of this contribution is to encourage library and information (LIS) professionals to draw on the initiatives by Carol Kuhlthau to align information seeking with learning theories and new roles for intermediaries. Considering the vast array of developments in information communication technology (ICT), and the challenges and pressures for continuing professional development (CPD) and reflection, it seems timely to encourage experimentation with the ideas of Kuhlthau on Zones of Intervention and Lev Vygotsky on Zones of Proximal Development (ZPD), as means to become au fait with these theories, ideas and related research, and to apply these theories and ideas on a practical level to offer opportunities for the continuing professional development of LIS professionals with specific reference to ICT, and to eventually also impact on the training of users. This contribution will be written against the background of research from information literacy, information behaviour (including information seeking), the learning theory of Vygotsky on Zones of Proximal Development, and continuing professional development. Although the information seeking process (ISP) model of Kuhlthau is widely cited, the idea of Zones of Intervention which she developed from the work of Vygotsky does unfortunately not feature strongly in the LIS literature. Considering the literature on Zones of Proximal Development, it can, however, hold much potential for LIS professionals to align support with information seeking with professional (optimal) development – especially if using the focus (Zones of Intervention and Zones of Proximal Development) as a means to become au fait, and if initially taking a more practical and relaxed approach as point of departure. Relatively few publications on Zones of Intervention and Zones of Proximal Development appear in the LIS literature. None of these are to the author's knowledge, aligned to the continuing professional development of LIS professionals on a practical level or with regard to fully exploiting ICT developments. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - This study assesses the information search behaviour of medical students when searching for a medical type task. Previous research provide information on the general search traits of medical students. This study shows how medical students search for medical information online for specific medical tasks. It examines the demographic variables that influence medical students search behaviour when searching across varying levels of task difficulty. Detailed aspects of a search session are analysed to examine this effect. Search sessions are broadly classified into: (a) querying details, (b) search results interaction details and (c) querying versus clicking behaviour and task completion time. An interactive information retrieval experiment type methodology (IIR) is used to study the interactive searching behaviour. A total of sixty (60) medical students participated in this study. Personal task and simulated situations were used to invoke the information search process. Results indicate that medical students issued long queries, were active in locating results and were slow and unproductive when searching on a difficult task. Demographic variables did not influence the search behaviour of medical students when searching across varying levels of task difficulty. Results of this study provide an understanding of the information search behaviour of medical students when searching for medical information online across varying levels of task difficulty. It also shows that demographic variables did not influence search behaviour when searching across varying level of task difficulty.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine whether an information literacy course/module is an appropriate intervention during the initial months of a humanities PhD, and if there is more that can be learned from the course participants that might provide a better understanding of their information behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was distributed to new humanities PhD students prior to their attending the course. A second questionnaire was distributed to those who had completed the course in full. Interviews were conducted with six participants to gain a richer understanding of how their information-seeking needs had evolved. Findings: Despite the relatively generic nature of the module, and the diversity of humanities research, the course had clear benefits for the participants. In their first year, scoping their topic and finding quality information can pose a challenge. The participants reported that the most appropriate time to attend the course is during the initial months. Some preferred to attend (or repeat) particular units later as workshops. The most valued elements were those that helped them bridge initial gaps. Face-to-face delivery is preferred. There is some potential for further one-to-one contact with librarians and additional follow-up workshops. Practical implications: This study can inform how librarians can better support PhD researchers in the humanities. Originality/value: The study is based around an established and accredited humanities PhD course that has already been adapted in various ways in terms of content and timing of delivery. Drawing on Kuhlthau's "Information Search Process", the study seeks a deeper understanding of a specific humanities group during the initial months of their PhD research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article reports on a field study of the information behavior of Grade 8 students researching an inquiry-based class history project. Kuhlthau's 7-stage Information Search Process (ISP) model forms the conceptual framework for the study. The aim of the study was to define an end game for the ISP model by answering the following question: How do the student participants' feelings, thoughts, and information behavior lead to the construction of new knowledge? Study findings tentatively indicate that knowledge construction results from an iterative process between the student and information, which can be divided into 3 phases. In the first phase, the students formulate questions from their previous knowledge to start knowledge construction; in the second phase, newly found topic information causes students to ask questions; and in the third phase, the students answer the questions asked by this newly found topic information. Based on these results and Kuhlthau's own ISP stage 7 assessment definition of the ISP model end game, we propose a model of knowledge construction inserted as an extra row in the ISP model framework. © 2015 ASIS&T.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this research was to study information seeking behavior and the pattern of reading behavior of faculty members of University of Social Welfare & Rehabilitation Sciences in using printed and electronic resources. Methods: The descriptive research method was a survey method. The research was implemented by using an organized questionnaire which was distributed among the statistical population, 114 faculty members of the university. Results: The findings show that meeting the faculty members' research needs is the most important purpose and stimulation for this group, because 91.2% of faculty members had chosen this objective. The mean of the central library role was 3.15 for meeting the faculty members' information needs. In faculty members' opinion, the mean of existing facilities in the website of University of Social Welfare & Rehabilitation Sciences was 3.29. Finally, the most resources used by this group were the printed resources. Discussion: Findings suggest that the facilities available in the central library and website of the university don't respond the faculty members' information needs. As the target group declared that they had problems in accessing information via the internet, it seems that they need for some formal training such as holding educational workshops about using library, internet and databases.

AB  - When information practices are understood to be shaped by social context, privilege and marginalization alternately affect not only access to, but also use of information resources. In the context of information, privilege, and community, politics of marginalization drive stigmatized groups to develop collective norms for locating, sharing, and hiding information. In this paper, we investigate the information practices of a subcultural community whose activities are both stigmatized and of uncertain legal status: the extreme body modification community. We use the construct of information poverty to analyze the experiences of 18 people who had obtained, were interested in obtaining, or had performed extreme body modification procedures. With a holistic understanding of how members of this community use information, we complicate information poverty by working through concepts of stigma and community norms. Our research contributes to human information behavior scholarship on marginalized groups and to Internet studies research on how communities negotiate collective norms of information sharing online. © 2013 ASIS&T.

AB  - Elections are a time at which objective fact vies with opinion and emotion leading up to the decision to vote. In the UK, the recent general election results proved to be a major surprise – one in which the hard data of the opinion polls and the questions asked in the focus groups were at odds with the expressed behaviour of the electorate. Before the pundits ‘regroup’ and the political groups re-establish their claimed hegemony over our intentions there is much to learn. For information scientists it is to recognize that the ‘dark arts’ of political campaigning contain many valuable techniques for effective information delivery and many lessons where information is irrelevant. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - The use of information technology for scholarly publication is now commonplace all over the world. Academic communities in Africa are part of this transformation. The purpose of this study was to investigate academics' use of scholarly electronic journal articles at Mzuzu University and assess the factors influencing their behaviour. Data collection instruments used for the study were the use of a questionnaire to the academics, interview with Deans of Faculties and follow up e-survey to some academics at Mzuzu University. The findings revealed that most academics had general knowledge of the electronic journals and this did not vary with education. There was no significant difference between gender and searching skills. It was evident that majority of academics prefer local publications and the use of electronic journal articles was for teaching and research. However, there were some barriers including teaching responsibilities; a lack of ICT and telecommunications; unreliable power supply; access to journals was restricted to campus and a lack of local content. Therefore, the study recommends that teaching and learning techniques such as improved use of teaching methods should be employed in order to create some time for other academic work including research and publication which contribute to the knowledge economy and the socio-economic development of Africa in particular Malawi. The study also suggest that provision of reliable power supply and development of local repositories are likely to play a vital role in providing access to local content and encouraging publication of local materials.

AB  - Despite the decline in youth participation in traditional politics over time, engagement in alternative forms of civic engagement is increasing. Existing research focuses on disenfranchised youth; in this paper, we describe an initial exploration of the role of information in initial and ongoing civic engagement. In this pilot study, we conducted a focus group with six teenagers (15–17 years old) recognized by their teachers and peers for being highly engaged in their schools and/or communities, in order to understand the self-described motivations, influences, and information behaviors of an important demographic which has not been widely studied in existing literature: youth who are highly engaged, but not yet eligible to vote in democratic elections. The participants were from six different provinces in Canada, and included a mix of rural, suburban, and urban youth. Participant responses suggested that their information environment, including the availability of information about civic affairs and opportunities to become directly involved, played a role in their socialization as engaged citizens. Moreover, they indicated that the effect of their information environment on their own civic engagement was cumulative over time: the more an issue appeared, the more likely they were to engage with it. Based on this focus group discussion, we suggest a set of interpretations that describe the role of information environments, the cumulative impact of civic information, and the levels of information consumption used by youth. While these theories will require additional data to confirm or reject, we expect that our observations will help inform efforts to engage youth in civic society. © 2015 Alieda Blandford, Dominique Taylor, Mike Smit

AB  - The study aimed to examine users’ self-perceived health information behavior according to their health literacy ability. The proficiency levels for health literacy were measured by scores on the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy Ability (S-TOFHLA). The study conducted self-administered surveys with 131 public library users and semi-structured intensive interviews with 20 users as a follow-up. Surveys found that most participants had proficient levels of health literacy, and there was an association between health literacy and some demographic characteristics such as gender and educational level. The majority assessed their health information behavior as high. Interviewees identified critical barriers to seeking, evaluating, and using health information delivered by public libraries. Findings provided insights into public libraries for better assistance for their users’ particular needs such as preferred resources or services. Above all, the findings acknowledged the challenges of current services, and suggested the strategies for coping with them. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate what types of information are crucial to support investment decisions, how investment professionals find information that they use to advise their clients, what types of sources of information are available to them, what sources they prefer, and what difficulties they experience in finding investment information. The study also explores the preferred ways and means to improve the information finding skills of investment professionals. Design/methodology/approach: Survey method was used to collect data about information-seeking behavior of investment professionals. An online questionnaire was used as a data collection instrument. The questionnaire contained eight questions about types of information required for investment analysis, information-finding practices of professionals, tools and services frequently used, and perceptions of investment professionals about the importance of sources of information. Participants were also asked about the use of social media and social software, and frequently-used information sources on investment opportunities. Findings: Investment professionals in Kuwait are relying heavily on electronic and digital sources to find investment information. Participants indicated that a wide variety of financial and non-financial information was needed to support their work. They reported frequent use of e-mail and smartphones to access internal and external information. While they benefitted from social media and social software, they considered company intranets and portals, external web sites, and business information services more important to fulfill their information needs. They appeared to be confident about their information-finding skills but considered training helpful in database and internet searching techniques. Originality/value: This study has made valuable information available on information-seeking practices of investment professionals, as very few previous studies could be found in the literature. The first phase was an exploratory study. The second phase of the study will use multiple methods such as interview and focus group discussions to probe further in certain areas. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Students turn to a variety of sources when searching for information for their academic assignments. This study uses findings from a survey given to 151 Israeli students attending a university in Israel. A questionnaire comprising 12 questions was administered regarding their information needs, information behavior, and difficulties in searching and writing an academic assignment. A special emphasis of the study was on the multicultural environment of the Israeli students and its effect on their information behavior. Results show that there is a significant difference between native language groups with regard to the use of search engines, the use of library services, and in the patterns of conducting their academic assignment. The findings imply that when the language of instruction and assignment delivery is the students' second language, they have special needs and should receive particular attention from the library and information services. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the leisure information behaviour of motor sport enthusiasts, examining: their information needs; their information seeking and sharing; what personal information they had; and their satisfaction with their information seeking and personal information management efforts. Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study examined participants’ information behaviour from a postpositivist and inductive research approach. An online survey was completed by 81 motor sport enthusiasts. The quantitative survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics, whilst the qualitative data were analysed using thematic coding. Findings: The research findings highlighted that enthusiasts engaged in mixed serious leisure. They required information before, during and after race events, and sought this primarily from online sources, as well as from other individuals. Totally, 90 participants shared information about their interest in motor sport with family, friends and fellow enthusiasts, primarily via e-mails (69 per cent) and Facebook (49 per cent). They also gathered information about motor sport, including photographs and memorabilia. Participants were satisfied with their information management strategies for their personal collections. Research limitations/implications: Participants were limited to motor sport enthusiasts in Australia, hence findings cannot be generalised more broadly. Practical implications: Understandings of enthusiasts’ information behaviour provide information management professionals with insights to work with this user community. Originality/value: This study fills a gap in the literature about leisure information behaviour of motor sport enthusiasts in Australia. It identifies and provides a typology of the 12 categories of information needed by enthusiasts. Provides a preliminary motor sport information behaviour model guided by the conceptual frameworks of the everyday life information seeking model; general models on information behaviour; and the information problem solving behaviour model. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce a dialogically based theory of documentary practices and document work as a promising framework for studying activities that are often conceptualised as information behaviour or information practices within Library and Information Science (LIS). Design/methodology/approach – An empirical example – a lesson on how to read railway timetables – is presented. The lesson stems from a research project including 223 Swedish lessons recorded in Swedish primary schools 1967-1969. It is argued that this lesson, as many empirical situations within LIS research, can fruitfully be regarded as documentary practices which include document work such as reading, rather than instances of information behaviour. Findings – It is found that the theoretical perspective of dialogism could contribute to the theory development within LIS, and function as a bridge between different subfields such as reading studies and documentary practices. Research limitations/implications – The framework is yet to be applied on a larger scale. This would require a willingness to go beyond the entrenched idea of information as the core theoretical concept and empirical object of study within LIS. Social implications – The theoretical framework offers a view of the relations between individuals, documents, and social contexts, through which it is possible to explore the social significance of core LIS concerns such as reading, literacy, and document work. Originality/value – The theoretical framework offers an alternative to the monologist, information-based theories and models of people’s behaviours and practices prevalent in LIS. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - A constant shifting between two main tenets of the information behavior (IB) field - centrality of the user and the essential role of context - has become a differentiation point for contemporary approaches in the field, but it also poses a major difficulty in tracing information practices. On one side, the user-centered paradigm asks researchers to focus on the individual; on the other, emerging context-centered approaches move the position of context into the foreground of information studies. Although there have been attempts to create "in between" approaches to achieve a compromise between these two positions, they have merely generated more positions between the two poles in a continuum between approaches focusing on the individual and those focusing on context. Such positioning not only creates an endless debate about the research focus of information studies but also limits such studies to a set of factors, a priori defined by the researcher. This article argues that IB research could benefit from actor-network theory, which could give the actors a space to perform their own positioning. © 2014 ASIS&T.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to report the results and the methods of a study which applied grounded theory to the information-seeking behaviour of social scientists when searching Arabic and English academic databases using both languages. Design/methodology/approach – The research applied the grounded theory approach using search experiments and semi-structured interviews. Think-aloud protocol during the experiment was used to capture the data from the subjects to allow a detailed analysis for the experiment. The semi-structured interviews followed each experiment and were analysed using the Strauss and Corbin (1990) version of the grounded theory, as were the think-aloud protocols. Findings – The results of the think-aloud protocols and the semi-structured interviews suggest that the information needs of the subjects varied depending on the language used. In addition, it was discovered that social scientists followed more tactics in searching the Arabic database for the same tasks searched in English during the experiment. This allowed more search strategies and search tactics to appear in seeking information in Arabic language. The study also proposed a model to account for the cross-language information-seeking behaviour. Research limitations/implications – This study identifies and compares the information-seeking behaviour of the social scientists in Jordanian universities in searching both Arabic and English academic databases. Therefore, the findings of this study cannot be generalized to other Arab countries, unless there was similar context. Originality/value – Few studies have investigated information-seeking behaviour using academic Arabic databases and proposed information-seeking behaviour models. No studies have compared information-seeking behaviour when using Arabic and English academic databases. The value of the current study arises by being the first study to identify and compare the information-seeking behaviour of social scientists by using grounded theory and proposing a cross-language information-seeking behaviour model. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - There has been an increase in research published on information behavior in recent years, and this has been accompanied by an increase in its diversity and interaction with other fields, particularly information retrieval. The aims of this study are to determine which researchers have contributed to producing the current body of knowledge on this subject, and to describe its intellectual basis. A bibliometric and network analysis was applied to authorship and co-authorship as well as citation and co-citation. According to these analyses, there is a small number of authors who can be considered to be the most productive and who publish regularly, and a large number of transient ones. Other findings reveal a marked predominance of theoretical works, some examples of qualitative methodology that originate in other areas of social science, and a high incidence of research focused on the user interaction with information retrieval systems and the information behavior of doctors. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - The field of everyday information behavior addresses how individuals interact with information in their daily lives. Previous research in the field has largely ignored the banal and quotidian portions of everyday life, such as grocery shopping, which represents a gap the current project fills. Through two empirical studies using qualitative methods, the present work presents the prevalence and variety of information sources used by grocery shoppers. Findings indicate that grocery shoppers rely on close human sources, domain-specific sources, and on surprisingly few online sources throughout the process of their grocery shopping. The findings demonstrate the information-richness of grocery shopping and suggest that other everyday spaces may be fruitful areas for information behavior research. © 2016 Melissa G. Ocepek

AB  - This paper examines the information needs and seeking behaviors in a group of amateur Mexican boxers. One-hundred ninety-three non-probability selected athletes responding to the questionnaire showed that boxers need information on defense, attack and counter-attack techniques. We also observed that the trainer serves as a source of information among these athletes. Four parameters were used to measure the information levels required by boxers and the extent of their use of information sources and resources.

AB  - This study reports the personal information management (PIM) behavior of university students under the backdrop of development of information and digital technology infrastructure in Pakistan. The PIM field has been explored through various perspectives in the developed world, but hardly any studies from the developing countries, specifically from the South Asian Region were found. The present, first study from Pakistan, adopted quantitative research design based on a pretested questionnaire to collect data from a sample of 221 students of master programs who were studying in their final semesters in five social sciences disciplines under Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences at the University of the Punjab (PU), Pakistan. The key findings revealed that most frequently used tools for relocating information once found are downloads on personal computers, self-created digital document (e.g. MSWord, Excel, Google Docs, etc.), URLs and hyperlinks. URLs are the most commonly used elements to save online information for future use. The revelation of their practices establishes that they need appropriate training regarding their personal information management. © 2016. University of the Punjab. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to highlight findings regarding human perception in allied disciplines and to argue that information behaviour research needs to find ways to address human characteristics that imply that: first, subjects are likely to fail to recognize information that is present in an environment and potentially relevant to a task at hand; and second, subjects would not be able to report on the fact that they failed to recognize the information. The authors also discuss as to how information behaviour research can address the aforementioned challenges resulting from human movement and perception. Design/methodology/approach – The author draws on the literature primarily in cognitive science and psychology to highlight the findings that are most relevant to the scientific study of information behaviour, to develop a model of the information environment in which information behaviour is situated, and to critically examine how data is collected in information behaviour research. Ways to provide more comprehensive information about information behaviour are also discussed. Findings – The literature in cognitive science and psychology suggests that failing to notice information relevant to a task at hand may not be the exception but to be expected, and needs to be taken into account by information behaviour researchers. Popular data collection methods including questionnaires and interviews do not pick that up because subjects would not be aware of the fact which means in turn that they cannot articulate the fact either. This suggests that: first, current models of information behaviour focus too much on one side of the coin; and second, information behaviour researchers may need to complement their data collection methods with data collection methods such as gaze tracking. Research limitations/implications – This is a conceptual paper based on the careful analysis of relevant research primarily in cognitive science and psychology. Relating theory to practice provides a strong indication of the general validity of the findings but there may be other aspects that have not been covered as yet. Originality/value – The paper is unique in that it critically reviews information behaviour research from a human perception and movement point of view. There have been papers criticizing information behaviour research from a methodological point of view. This paper adds to that body of work and proposes a way forward. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report the results of a study of voters' online behaviour conducted during the 2011 Scottish parliamentary election campaign. Design/methodology/approach: The study used an interactive, electronically-assisted interview method, where 64 citizens were observed and questioned while they searched for, browsed and used information on the web sites and social media sites of political parties and candidates standing for election to the Scottish Parliament. Findings: While online campaign sites were generally regarded as serving a useful purpose, as being easy to use and understand, relatively interesting and likely to be visited again, there was very little evidence in this study to indicate that they had any significant impact on voting behaviour during the 2011 Scottish campaign. Rather, the participants' comments suggest that more traditional information sources, particularly print and broadcast media, coupled with long-established campaign techniques, such as leaflet deliveries and door knocking, continue to be more influential in determining Scottish voters' democratic choices. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents results obtained from a sample of 64 citizens of North-east Scotland. As such, the authors would lay no claims to the results of the study being applicable outwith the Scottish setting. Practical implications: The findings have implications for those candidates successfully elected to the Scottish Parliament, who may have to significantly modify their information practices on entering parliament. The study also has implications for the broader, international, political and information research communities, as it has added to a rather sparse body of qualitative work on voters' online election information needs. The voter-centred methodological approach used in the study has the potential to be used or adopted more widely, to aid our understanding of the use and impact of online campaign tools. Originality/value: This study forms part of an ongoing series of investigations by the authors, which has examined the use of the internet by political parties and candidates during parliamentary election campaigns in Scotland. These are the only such studies which have looked specifically at the Scottish political arena. Internationally, most studies of users of online campaign resources have been largely quantitative in nature. The qualitative research discussed in this paper is, therefore, particularly timely and potentially significant. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - A metatheory is presented and diagrammed as an integrated conceptual framework for information seeking and use. It represents the symbiotic relationship between users and the technological environment. Receiving and adapting to information is achieved through each user's biological satisficing procedures defined by group information practices, namely, noticing information, appraising it and evaluating it. Information use is achieved through optimizing procedures, namely, activating goal-setting intentions, constructing a plan and executing it through acting upon the technological environment to attain one's goals. Evidence is given by listing a variety of information seeking behaviors that others have identified in their review of the literature, then showing how each element fits within the model, as well as by analyzing the interpretive discourse of college students while engaged in carrying out assigned information tasks. Each discourse segment in the samples was categorized as either an affective, cognitive or sensorimotor procedure carried out by the user, and transcribed as a string or sequence. This code sequence was then compared with the sequence produced when the model's mapping is followed. Every discourse sample inspected contained the six categories specified by the model. The metatheory is suitable for providing a common framework for discussing various areas of information behavior research. © 2014, Leon James, & Diane Nahl.

AB  - This paper investigated barriers to information seeking in Secondary School Libraries in Ado-Ekiti by using Kuhlthau's framework of intermediation with Harris and Dewdney's principles on information seeking. A random sampling technique was used to select five Private Secondary Schools (out of twenty Private Secondary Schools) in Ado-Ekiti while saturation sampling was used in selection of participants for this research. A Case study design using focus group discussion, observation and unstructured interview methods were used. A focus group discussion (group interview) was used to gather data separately from JSS II and SSS II students in each school; it was recorded using a Camcorder tool, Galaxy Tab and Samsung Android Phone Voice Recorder; while two principals, a teacher in charge of the library and one student prefect were interviewed. The sample for this study was therefore two hundred and fifty two(252) comprising of JSS II and SSS II students; two principals, a teacher and a student prefect. A structured interview was used as a pilot study for this research by selecting five teachers and librarians from each of the earlier randomly selected schools for the research. Thus twenty five teachers and librarians were used as a pilot study for this research. Qualitative data analysis was applied, thus the data (from the focus group discussion and structured interview) were analyzed by transcribing the recorded data and coding them. Like codes were selected, arranged and placed under separate facets that represent them; and evidences of research were selected for analyses. The observations written down (regarding the condition of school libraries visited) were aligned with the transcribed data and analyses of the interview and focus group discussions. Findings showed that secondary school students are motivated by the urge within themselves to be outstanding, by the schools' interpretation of their "free periods" as "library periods", by the organisation and serenity of the library and by the roles of the teachers and student prefects. They were found to meet diverse barriers ranging from restrictions of access to the library and library materials, none presence of a permanent teacher in the library and no qualified teacher librarian. Noise making and unmannerly attitudes of library users, untidiness of the library, dateless of materials in the library and lack of organisation of library materials were other barriers found. Recommendations were provided at the end of the study with focus on more involvement of the Ministry of Education in School libraries.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to better understand the dynamic nature of the relevance judgment process and the influence of work task on that process. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical study reported here examined the information seeking behavior of a group of undergraduate college students assigned a set of research assignments (work tasks). Subjects recorded their selection of documents used for an assignment and the criteria used to judge those documents relevant. Statistical analysis was used to associate relevance judgments and the criteria used to make those judgments with work tasks. Findings: Findings indicate a strong statistical association between work task and criteria used to judge relevance. Findings also include identification of specific criteria used to judge relevance and the relative importance of those criteria based on frequency of selection of criteria for a work task. Research limitations/implications: Findings provide additional insights into the dynamic nature of the relevance judgment process. Relevance judgment influences revealed in these findings in the form of criteria used to make relevance judgments further explicate the relevance judgment process and provide suggestions for the improvement of information retrieval systems and information literacy efforts. Originality/value: Understanding the relevance judgment process is critical to understanding information behavior in general. Few studies have examined relevance criteria selections as part of the relevance judgment process and fewer still have studied these selections in relation to work tasks. A better understanding of this relationship is an essential part of understanding the dynamic nature of the relevance judgment process and its influences. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Non-native English speakers (NNESs) often search in English due to the limited availability of information in their native language on the Web. Information seeking in a non-native language can present special challenges for users. Current research literature on non-native language search behavior is insufficient and even less is known about how online systems and tools may accommodate NNESs’ needs and assist their behaviors. To gain a better understanding of user behavior and the search process of NNESs, this paper presents a study of online searching in English as a foreign language (EFL) or second-language (L2). Particular attention is paid to language selection, search challenges, query formulation and reformulation, as well as user interaction with online systems and tools. Results from eight focus groups (36 participants) and 36 questionnaires indicate NNESs face a unique set of challenges that may not be present for native speakers when searching for information in English. A user interaction model is abstracted to address the iterative and spiral search process of NNESs. Implications for design of systems and tools to assist this particular user group are discussed.

AB  - Although health information is widely available, information acquisition patterns may vary according to where one lives. Using Lievrouw's (2001) information environments (IE) theory, this mixed methods study compares three regional HIV/AIDS information environments in rural Canada. In accordance with IE theory, findings showed regional variation in institutional aspects of HIV/AIDS information environments: health institution service models; resource munificence and technology use; and some measures of social engagement and source availability. Differences were also present in the personal/relational aspects of environments: information network characteristics and levels of interpersonal interaction. However, in divergence from IE theory, regional success rates for answering HIV/AIDS-related questions were similar (86.26-89.34 percent). Furthermore, individual-level factors were more important than network position in predicting participants' success rates. Yet, in line with IE theory, there were regional differences in the barriers that people affected by HIV/AIDS faced when seeking answers to their questions. These unaddressed barriers suggest that further development of IE theory requires incorporation of institutional capacity: provider knowledge, responsiveness, and service availability. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose — This paper aims to gain insights from existing models of information behaviour, building on them to develop a new model which, unlike most others, encompasses both information seeking and communication. By identifying key factors affecting the successful communication and use of information, it is hoped that the model will be of practical value both to information providers and to users. Design/methodology/approach — The paper is based on a literature search and analysis of well-established models of information seeking and of communication, from which a new conceptual model is constructed. Findings — Existing models have elements in common, though most models in library and information science focus on information seeking and the information user, while those from the field of communications focus on the communicator and the communication process. A new model is proposed that includes key elements of existing models and takes into account not just the information seeker but also the communicator or information provider. Originality/value — The model developed in this paper is the first to combine elements from both information seeking and communication models. Being built on previous research, it can be used to investigate the practical value of the model itself and the elements that it has in common with other models. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Methods: an exploratory study was conducted of members of a scientific community constituted for an institutional collaboration project in which most researchers belong to the areas of pure, life and applied sciences. The variables selected were degree, age, research type and stage, information resources and information sources. A questionnaire was applied to community members and results were analyzed descriptively. Non-parametric statistical tests were used to verify the existence of correlation between the variables selected for the study. Results: a definition was made of the information behavior of members of the scientific community. The library was found to be the most common information resource. An increase was observed in the use of periodic publications (journals and yearbooks). There is a vital need of contacts with colleagues or peers. Electronic texts are increasingly accepted by members of the study community. Conclusions: the information behavior patterns of members of the study scientific community are similar to those found in research conducted in other countries and in experiences consulted for the present study. The library stands out as the most common information resource. Periodic publications and contacts with colleagues or peers are a priority option to access first hand published results.

AB  - This paper reviews information practices used by transnational migrants to become familiar with new urban surroundings. Drawing on interviews with 26 participants, all of whom had moved to New York City in the past 2 years, I analyze the interrelatedness of people, city space, and technology. By rooting my analysis in the experiences of transnational newcomers to New York, my investigation is directed both at library and information science (LIS) scholarship in transnational experience and urban informatics as an area of study. The findings section first addresses participants' practices for becoming familiar with their surroundings as embedded in everyday routines using Bergson's (1911) construct of habits as a means of organizing stimulus. I then develop an analysis of wandering, which emerged as an information practice used by participants to become familiar with their neighborhoods. Building on these themes, I suggest implications for human information behavior theory, arguing that LIS scholars should articulate more clearly and across a wider range of disciplines the concepts of mobile and ubiquitous technologies. © 2014 ASIS&T.

AB  - This study aims to explore users’ eye movement patterns in their evaluation of search results and the corresponding individual webpages. Eye-tracking logs, questionnaires, and interviews were applied to collect data. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and social network analysis were utilized in data analysis. Two transition networks for search result evaluation and individual document evaluation were obtained by social network analysis tool. The findings show that in search result evaluations, participants examined abstract, title and URL the most among all the elements, while in individual document evaluation, full text was examined the most. The transition networks further indicates the most frequent transition action is shifting from title to abstract. For individual document evaluation. The findings will help the enhancement of interface design of search result pages and individual document pages in order to promote search effectiveness and efficiency.

AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to provide an overview of recent literature on nurses’ and midwives’ information behaviour, with a particular focus on sources used and barriers encountered. Design/methodology/approach – Comprehensive searching was undertaken and an analysis of the appropriate literature carried out. Findings – Practitioners within the nursing profession have a marked preference for interactive and human sources of information. They habitually associate information seeking with professional development rather than with clinical practice. Lack of time is the most frequently reported problem; also, they frequently lack confidence in searching and appraising the professional literature and in applying research in practice. Cultural factors may inhibit information seeking in the workplace, and access to appropriate information technology may be limited. Practical implications – As a group, nurses and midwives present significant challenges to health library and information professionals seeking to design services to meet their needs.Aperceived lack of access to information resources may be associated with pervasive information literacy skill deficits, with the inability to undertake critical appraisal of material that is retrieved, or with the lack of a workplace culture that is supportive of information seeking. To reach nurses and midwives, more than diligent marketing is required; library and information professionals need to work closely with the holders of nursing and midwifery research, practice development and educational roles within their institutions on “embedded”, specific information initiatives. Originality/value – An overview of recent work is presented on the information behaviour of nurses and midwives within developed economies, focusing particularly on the UK. It may be of interest and value to health librarians and to nursing and midwifery educators in facilitating evidence-based practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper presents findings for a research study which investigated the information behaviour of final students of Mzuzu University in Malawi. Even after being imparted with necessary skills in how to search and locate relevant information, the author observed that students still find difficulties to find information that they require. A paper based questionnaire was designed and administered to two hundred and fifty four (254) final year students belonging to the five faculties of the University of which two hundred and forty three (243) responded to the questionnaire A mixed method questionnaire survey was used. Stratified sampling in which students were divided into different strata according to the faculty they belong to was adopted. The Kuhlthau's Information Search Process model was used as a guiding theoretical framework for this study. The results show that most of the students relied heavily on the Internet (64.6%), search engines like Google (56.2%) and the OPAC (45%). When searching for information, the majority of students did not use truncation (98.3%) or Boolean logic (98.8%).It has also been established that students did not fully conform to Kuhlthau's ISP model of information behaviour.

AB  - This qualitative study extends our earlier research on what we have learned about the information needs of Malaysian male juvenile offenders. This study explores the extent to which the prison library is used as the environment for information seeking of male juvenile delinquents. Data were collected using participants' observation with 27 juveniles (13 to 21 years old) living in five correctional schools in Malaysia. Our observation at all research sites has led us to conclude that the prison library does not play much role in addressing the participants' information needs. The findings in this research are useful for the purpose of designing and delivering the best possible library services to this group. findings add to the limited literature on juvenile offenders' information needs and how the prison libraries meet the needs of this people.

AB  - Information seeking and use are critically important for people living with HIV/AIDS and for those who care for people with HIV/AIDS. In addition, the HIV/AIDS context is characterized by significant affective or emotional aspects including stigma, fear, and coping. Thus, studies of information behavior in this context should be expected to take account of emotional variables. In information behavior scholarship, emotional variables have been marginalized in favor of a focus on cognitive aspects, although in recent years greater attention has been paid to the affective realm. This study used quantitative content analysis to explore the degree to which information behavior studies across a range of disciplines actually include affect or emotion in their analyses. Findings suggest that most studies pay little or no attention to these variables, and that attention has not changed over the past 20. years. Those studies that do account for emotion, however, provide excellent examples of information behavior research that can lead the way for future work. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Past researches on students’ information seeking behaviour concluded that students have difficulty in searching the literature and unable to find the required information during the searching processes. The problem must be addressed as students need exposure on the knowledge of information searching and retrieval. This study explores graduate students’ information seeking behaviour in seeking research-based information with the intention of accomplishing their research tasks. The data was collected through survey method by using web-based questionnaire. A total of 193 respondents have responded to the survey questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows version 12.0. The findings of this study conclude that most of the graduate students prefer to use electronic information sources when seeking for research-based information. This can be used as guideline to improve information services and facilitate graduate students to construct better strategies during information seeking activities in effectively finding the relevant research-based information. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology to audit the functioning of an organizational intelligence system that covers all human, informational, technological and procedural elements involved. The methodological process is based in a triangulation of data, qualitative techniques and perspectives, organized in three phases: exploratory, intermediate and focused. A literature review, a participant observation and a case study in the intelligence department of a Spanish private security company are carried out. The results enabled the authors to propose the preference for an operational advisory audit, the operational principles, the procedures to define priority elements and aspects to be audited, the stages and the activities to be carried out, and the techniques and instruments for the collection and analysis of information. The intelligence audit makes it possible to identify the active elements and the relevant actions in the intelligence system and understand how they function within the framework of their relationships with the organization to which it belongs and its environment. The intelligence system should be audited by paying attention to strategic business processes and taking into account the organizational structure, procedures, culture and information behaviour involved. The proposed intelligence audit can be applied to the planning and assessment of any kind of organization due to its comprehensiveness and flexibility. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - In the literature on e-book adoption in academic and research libraries, user acceptance is seldom rigorously examined. As take-up of e-books has grown to achieve mass adoption, what industry analysts Gartner describe as the "plateau of productivity", the question of user acceptance may seem less relevant. However, if attention is switched from downloads to information behaviour, expectations and gratification, the picture of acceptance is more nuanced, with some studies pointing towards user disaffection.This paper reports on the information behaviour of another category of e-book users, i.e. apparently satisfied or intensive users. The paper is based on data analysis and interpretation of data from transaction logs generated by the Ebook Library (EBL) platform in an academic library. The paper forms part of a broader investigation of technology acceptance and options for improving the user experience of e-books within an academic library context. Three years of e-books transaction logs were mined for evidence of "power user" behaviour. The paper demonstrates how power user behaviour is different from other user behaviour, shows which variables determine such behaviour, and creates a probabilistic model that can determine a power user based on these variables. The paper also describes how this model was validated against the log data. © 2014 © 2014 Australian Library & Information Association.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine information seeking behaviour targeted to music information seeking by amateur musicians, accompanied with empirical evidence from a survey on a community concert band. While several studies in the literature have examined information seeking in the context of hedonic motives (e.g. entertainment oriented), music information can also be used for utilitarian purposes by providing amateur musicians the necessary tools to improve their skill and become better in their practice. Design/methodology/approach – A review of the literature on music information seeking and an empirical study on members of an amateur concert band are presented. The theoretical construct of the survey is informed by Wilsons’ macro model of information seeking behaviour. This is employed in order to understand information motives and needs, as well as obstacles in information seeking of musicians. Findings – Musicians seek information not only for entertainment but for educational purposes as well as for the acquisition of certain music works. The use of the internet for information seeking as well as the gradual adoption of online social networks has provided access to new musical resources within the digital music networks. Originality/value – A person-centred approach for information seeking behaviour is studied and adapted for musicians. The survey provides new information behaviour results for designers of music information spaces which in turn are creating a new model of the relationship between music and society. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article draws from general and specific literature to present the way food consumer information behavior is executed from the stage of information need recognition to that of information use. Information needs are derivative needs, which originate from primary (physiological or psychological) needs. After need arousal, the consumer starts seeking food information by using one or more of the available out-of-store (published material, media, experts, institutional bodies, and social milieu) or in-store (store personnel, food labels) information sources. The information gathered is evaluated and, when it is judged insufficient in terms of quantity and/or quality, the consumer continues to seek information by following other paths. Simultaneously and/or subsequently, the information is refined, processed, and translated into different behavioral responses. The article concludes by highlighting some open issues and by proposing new research directions. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Prescriptions for the successful provision of e-health information must integrate the varying needs of individuals for maintaining their personal health. Research emanating from both individual differences and health information searching literature suggests that a person's characteristics influence the pursuit of online health information. This paper addresses the factors influencing variation in health information searching strategies based on demographic differences among healthcare information consumers in the United States of America. Specifically, the authors evaluate variation in health information searching about diabetes within a population that varies by race, gender, age, socio-economic status, and education. The theory utilized in this research was the Individual Differences Theory of Gender and IT. Findings from this interpretive, qualitative study showed that differences such as race, gender, age, socio economic class, and geographic location all have an influence on searching behavior. However, it was found that these factors work together to influence behavior, rather than independently. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - This study is aimed at exploring the information behavior of the elderly people amongst us. A survey research design was adopted. Four objectives were set for the study and the interview was used to elicit information from respondents. Findings showed that 63% were male while 37% were female. Findings also reveal that the information needs of elders covered health conditions (98%), pension/finance (92%), government policies (34%), current affairs (53%), and transport (63%) among others. The most preferred source of information as revealed by the study is the use of family members (98%). This is followed by radio/television (92%). Use of information to solve health issues (92%) topped the list of the use of information by the elderly. Factors affecting information seeking behavior of the elderly include, problem of equity in information materials (97%), inadequate fund (91%), lack of access to information (35%), and lack of suitable reading material (80%). The paper concludes that publishers should take into consideration the elderly population amongst us, thereby publishing suitable reading (bold print) materials. Recommendations were put forward to enhance access to information by the elderly.

AB  - A recurrent theme in LIS literature is the tendency of young people not to evaluate rigorously the information with which they come into contact. Although many information literacy models stress the need to take a critical approach, the reality of behaviour is often very different. Recent research conducted in an English high school has explored the importance that teenagers attach to 10 particular evaluative criteria. Data were contributed by 149 youngsters via an online questionnaire. Participants felt that information on the Web should be current/topical, free from spelling and grammatical errors and easily verifiable elsewhere but authorship was much less of a priority to them. The findings are likely to be of special relevance to information literacy teachers who are defining priorities for their own programmes. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Several prominent scholars suggest that investigations of human information behavior or “information needs, seeking, and uses” rarely measure how received information is applied or its effects on the recipient, that is, its outcomes. This article explores this assertion via systematic analysis of studies published in journals between 1950 and 2012. Five time periods and four journals were sampled, including 1,391 journal articles, 915 of which were empirical studies. Based on these samples, the percentage of studies of information outcomes climbed from zero in the 1950s and 1960s, to 8% in recent research reports. The barriers to studying information outcomes and possible future research on this topic are explored. © 2015 ASIS&T

AB  - The article reports a field study investigating the temporality of the information behavior of 44 grade 8 students from initiation to completion of their school inquiry-based history project. The conceptual framework for the study is Kuhlthau's 6-stage information-search process (ISP) model. The objective of the study is to test and extend ISP model concepts. As per other ISP model studies, our study measured the evolution of the feelings, thoughts, and actions of the study participants over the 3-month period of their class project. The unique feature of this study is the unlimited access the researchers had to a real-life history class, resulting in 12 separate measuring periods. We report 2 important findings of the study. First, through factor analysis, we determined 5 factors that define the temporality of completing an inquiry-based project for these grade 8 students. The second main finding is the importance of the students' consultations with their classmates, siblings, parents, and teachers in the construction of the knowledge necessary to complete their project. © 2014 ASIS&T.

AB  - The origin of this research is illuminated by CIBER’s exploratory research on Trust in Scholarly Communications conducted in 2012-2013. This study’s interest lies with Malaysian academic researchers both as producers and consumers and how they deal with the quality and trust consequences of the digital transition, especially, but not exclusively, the impact of social media and open access publishing on their scholarly communications. This paper reports on a survey on citation behaviour, part of a wider study of gauging quality and trustworthiness in scholarly communication in the emerging digital environment. It focuses on investigating what Malaysian researchers trust or find reliable to cite in their publications. In order to make the study results comparable, we adapted the same questionnaire that CIBER has developed and used in previous surveys. We used surveymonkey.com. a web-based questionnaire which has been widely used for surveys. The questionnaire went online on the 1 October 2014 and closed on the 30 December 2014. More than 400 respondents completed the questionnaire. The answers were analysed quantitatively and then grouped under descriptive headings of the types of reasons for citation provided. Similar to CIBER’s study, the motivations for citing were found to be complex and multi-faceted but, in nearly all cases, researchers do regard the authority and trustworthiness of the cited source as an important factor in choosing to cite it. Citing behaviour includes an acknowledgement of useful intellectual content, and this process cannot be separated from the researcher’s position in networks of trusted social and research influence. The digital transition has provided tools to help maintain and develop these social networks and it has also made it easier for researchers to investigate the credentials of the sources of documents. Peer-reviewed journals still hold influential. Measures of establishing trust and authority do not seem to have changed profoundly in Malaysia. The digital environment may bring ease and convenience to scholarly communication, but it gives more pressure for scholarly communication on high quality platforms. Looking at the researchers’ trust-related views, it is emphasised that academic librarians apply their understanding of scholarly communication towards delivering the right services to meet the needs of the academic community. © 2016, University of the Punjab.

AB  - The study of faculty members and PhD scholars of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir (SKUAST-K) was conducted to bring about current image about some core issues related to use of both online and offline e-resources. Attempt has also been made to ascertain some significant facts about their search strategy/skills and level of satisfaction. The constituent faculties of the University under study were surveyed through a structured questionnaire distributed among 90 subjects in proportion with their number. The study reveals that majority of the faculty members and PhD scholars of SKUAST-Kashmir are familiar about e-resources like CDROM databases, e-journals, e-books, etc. Scholars preferably use Laptops and mobiles as compared to Desktops for browsing their needed information. As expected, it is divulged that scholars prefer Google search engine mostly for browsing their desired information and 'keyword' or 'subject' searching techniques are applied by them to retrieve precise information. The respondents seem to be less skilled to use the advanced search techniques as a good number of respondents claimed that they have never used Boolean Gates (AND, OR, NOT); Wild Cards (*; #; $; etc); Truncation marks (??; #; *; etc) and the Phrasal Search "----". It calls for speedy implementation of Information literacy programs within the campus. Moreover, the study also reveal that scientists and the PhD scholars of SKUAST-Kashmir are not much satisfied with staff assistance; infrastructure; condition of computers and also face problems like internet connectivity and accessibility of e-resources, which is never encouraging.

AB  - This paper offers and analysis of the cognitive processes entailed in classification, mathematical calculation, memorization and categorization tasks. Empirical studies of information seeking behaviors commonly ask participants to do complex tasks. As a result, only general cognitive strategies may be deduced about information seeking behaviors. To these question in greater depth, this research breaks down the information behavior into atomized tasks reflecting cognitive processes. Three data collection techniques were employed: log files, video recording and in-depth interviews. Grounded Theory was employed as a data analysis method, allowing researchers to discern the behaviors of subjects. The study uncovered several cognitive processes as the main components of simple information-seeking tasks. Moreover, these cognitive processes constitute the core of the subjects’ behaviors of the participants. This study supports the furtherance theoretical models of behaviors for several information-seeking tasks, understood as chain of cognitive processes. Some of these cognitive processes apparently are common to entirely distinct tasks, such as classification, memorization and categorization. © 2014 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

AB  - Compelled Nonuse of Information (CNI) is a model of information behavior developed by Houston (2009, 2011a). CNI posits the existence of nonvolitional mechanisms that force information behaviors beyond the control of the individual. The CNI model consists of six primary CNI types: intrinsic somatic barriers, socio-environmental barriers, authoritarian barriers, threshold knowledge shortfall barriers, attention shortfall barriers, and filtering barriers. This typology of information interaction limitations functions across a full range of socio-economic contexts and thus lends itself to analysis of intractable power-based inequities such as intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV includes physical, mental, financial, and social attacks that, if known, generate socially sanctioned responses of both formal (e.g., law enforcement) and informal (e.g., pastoral) approaches. Using the CNI framework to analyze information factors in distinct facets of the IPV experience, as identified in the cross disciplinary research on this phenomenon, this article provides a practical application of CNI to a complicated, high-risk phenomenon. © 2013 ASIS&T.

AB  - In this study, we concentrate on analyzing and building the dynamical user profiling to describe users’ multi-dimensional features and properties, in order to assist the individualized information seeking and recommendation process in social networking environments. A set of user attributes are introduced and defined to describe the basic user profiling in accordance with the analysis of information behaviors, and several centrality based measures are proposed and developed to describe the users’ importance and contributions with regards to a group of users based on their social connections in the DSUN (Dynamically Socialized User Networking) model. The experimental results are discussed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed methods. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
